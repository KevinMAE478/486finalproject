On one hand, they really want to make it the next esport, but they also want to appeal to a large casual audience. \n\nFor CS:GO, for example, valve has completely embraced it as an esport. Nobody really plays CS casually (I mean just pick it up and enjoy it as a shooter, there's pretty much nothing in the way of story, and the game is ugly as all hell) but as a competitive shooter it is top tier because it's pretty much a game about core FPS mechanics. What makes you a better player than someone else? Aim, ability to hold angles (this also translates OW, though it translates into positioning and using cover because the high time to kill and abilities make it less valuable to shoot first/force the enemy to check angles), ability to buy/eco (not technically a core FPS mechanic, but there's usually something analogous in most multi-round games. \n\nThe other huge esport is league. I don't know too much about it, so I can't speak as much about it, but to the best of my understanding riot promotes the esport pretty heavily in-game. LOL is more interesting because it has the potential to be played casually (story, interesting characters, it's the sort of thing that someone would pick up because it's pretty and they liked the worldbuilding) but it's pushed really heavily into being competitive. Honestly, I think this one grew more from its initial popularity (first free stand-alone MOBA, and one of the first major MOBAs apart from DotA and that one paid one which flopped) combined with the way the genre is geared towards competitive play, which riot embraced. I'd like to hear someone who knows the game better talk about why it's so big, how it grew, etc. because I honestly don't know too much about league.\n\nThen, you have Overwatch. The game is pretty, has interesting characters, is fun to just play, it's perfect for the casual player. Oh, and it's made by blizzard and is initially immensely successful, so it attracts a huge audience. And then there's no creator promotion for pro play. Balance changes are \"lucio felt less impactful to play\" while a lot of Jeff's speeches have shoutouts to people trolled by the ARG, or hanzo mains. Nothing wrong with that, it's funny, but it shows where the focus is right now. The player base is largely casual players, and there's no push to get those players involved in the game as an esport. Of course, you have the comp community, but it's very divided from the majority, and there's almost no push to merge the two. And realistically, I don't think it's something that would be solved by the players. It's not like people from this sub could start posting tournaments to r/ow, because it already is posted there, it just doesn't rise to the front page. And reddit is only ~1/25 of all the players. If you're someone who plays the game but doesn't go anywhere to discuss it or watch it or whatever, how would you even know that there is pro play that you can watch, aside from becoming interested in it. Getting the majority of the player base would have to be a developer move. I'm guessing that based on devs' obvious desire for OW to be a huge esport (OWL) and lack of promotion for OW as an esport, they're waiting for OWL to launch first before promoting it because they want players who get into pro play to get into OWL to make it a big success. Having more people watch OWL is more valuable because it directly profits blizzard while having more viewers at apex or dreamhack means very little (I mean, more dedicated players, but that's not as good as having x amount of viewers to sell a spot in OWL for y million dollars.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s more of a fundamental problem with how blizzard is approaching overwatch. On one hand, they really want to make it the next esport, but they also want to appeal to a large casual audience. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For CS:GO, for example, valve has completely embraced it as an esport. Nobody really plays CS casually (I mean just pick it up and enjoy it as a shooter, there&amp;#39;s pretty much nothing in the way of story, and the game is ugly as all hell) but as a competitive shooter it is top tier because it&amp;#39;s pretty much a game about core FPS mechanics. What makes you a better player than someone else? Aim, ability to hold angles (this also translates OW, though it translates into positioning and using cover because the high time to kill and abilities make it less valuable to shoot first/force the enemy to check angles), ability to buy/eco (not technically a core FPS mechanic, but there&amp;#39;s usually something analogous in most multi-round games. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other huge esport is league. I don&amp;#39;t know too much about it, so I can&amp;#39;t speak as much about it, but to the best of my understanding riot promotes the esport pretty heavily in-game. LOL is more interesting because it has the potential to be played casually (story, interesting characters, it&amp;#39;s the sort of thing that someone would pick up because it&amp;#39;s pretty and they liked the worldbuilding) but it&amp;#39;s pushed really heavily into being competitive. Honestly, I think this one grew more from its initial popularity (first free stand-alone MOBA, and one of the first major MOBAs apart from DotA and that one paid one which flopped) combined with the way the genre is geared towards competitive play, which riot embraced. I&amp;#39;d like to hear someone who knows the game better talk about why it&amp;#39;s so big, how it grew, etc. because I honestly don&amp;#39;t know too much about league.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, you have Overwatch.

This means it&amp;#39;s not only a class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All pro cs and cod players can use all competitive weapons at least competently.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those weapons are the generalists. cs 1.6: AK/M4 - Deag - awp. CSGO: a bit more complicated now due to economy changes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Full buy: Ak/M4 - AWP - deagle/five seven/tec9 and sometimes a p250, depends.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Eco: Tec9 - p250 - ump&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Counter eco: either full buy or some ump/mag7 shit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall more weapons viable, but mostly because of money and money is the most general shit in cs because it&amp;#39;s how you win.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now for Cod 4 promod pre nerfs or some shit can&amp;#39;t remember: 4 smg 1 scope. After changes: 2 rifles 2 smgs 1 scope. Iirc they nerfed the smgs because they were too general and could just evade rifles on what they were good, which is the common trend of generalists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the really short reason of why generalists are so good, it&amp;#39;s because they normally can viably ignore the strengths of the specialists unless that specialists is overpowered at that role (Awp/scope on cs/cod) and they&amp;#39;re flexible enough to adapt to every situation they are thrown into. Really that&amp;#39;s all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;everyone needs to be able to entry frag, lurk, throw smokes etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This are specific mechanics of each game and they will not be the same from OW to CS to cod to whatever. Overall though smokes are the most flexible shit in cs and cod when it comes to utility and even though I sound like a broken record, they are the most general and useful of the utility available in both games normally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to see some truly assymetrical team comps with 1 hero per match (on both sides) and see how it breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The reason drafting is useful is because it allows for generalists to shine and be reliable.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really 2 examples of OW specialists would be: Reinhardt and Lucio, both being so good at their job that they normally eclipse other picks with Lucio still being at over 95% pick usage on competitive. 2 other examples of generalists would be Soldier and Anna, not specifically top dog at most stuff, but flexible enough to adapt to anything they are thrown at.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgcqfwy", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492413225.0, "created_utc": 1492384425.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcodgm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ShootEmLater", "parent_id": "t1_dgce2z2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "I agree with you except where you talk about 'generalists' in cs and cod.
