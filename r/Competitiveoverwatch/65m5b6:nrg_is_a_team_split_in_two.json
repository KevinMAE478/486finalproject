His Winston was better, but didn't get much support. I don't think they played much Zarya along side him. That's more a team problem.

The rest of the the team also didn't pressure the enemy shield enough or gave him the support to drop his.  \n\nThat leaves Harblue and I want to end with a positive bit.

Other Lucios they faced were able to make plays of their own, but we didn&amp;#39;t get that from him. His shot calling and ult tracking didn&amp;#39;t look good at all either, but communication around the board seemed poor. I think there might have been a bit of an intelligence drop with the departure of Seagull that Mendo didn&amp;#39;t feel comfortable picking up from his sub position.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lot has already been said about Numlocked. He was passable most of the time when he played passively, but he dropped the ball on some key moments. When he played more aggressive, he was just awful. Not communicating his intend and thus no follow up at the best and just being in no man&amp;#39;s land doing nothing when his team got shredded at the worst. His Winston was better, but didn&amp;#39;t get much support. I don&amp;#39;t think they played much Zarya along side him. That&amp;#39;s more a team problem. Additionally, losing shield wars also isn&amp;#39;t just the Reinhardt&amp;#39;s fault. The rest of the the team also didn&amp;#39;t pressure the enemy shield enough or gave him the support to drop his.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That leaves Harblue and I want to end with a positive bit. He played consistently well on both Zarya as Hog. Definitely felt like the rock in the team! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgc1vs0", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492379954.0, "created_utc": 1492351154.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 11}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m5b6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m5b6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m5b6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m5b6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m5b6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65m5b6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgd0iwm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "T1nkr", "parent_id": "t1_dgbf2xu", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He has uploaded a couple of his scrims onto his youtube channel.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has uploaded a couple of his scrims onto his youtube channel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dgd0iwm", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492426892.0, "created_utc": 1492398092.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "more"}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbf2xu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 87, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dafinsrock", "parent_id": "t1_dgbecia", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "He hit a couple of pretty big sleeps.
