You guys held that much, now they need to hold it for approximately the same amount to win and gain SR.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If they didn&amp;#39;t want that to happen, they should&amp;#39;ve played the objective more on their pushes so that they&amp;#39;d at least get more of the percent. &lt;strong&gt;This is not an example of asymmetrical win conditions&lt;/strong&gt;, but forcing your team to get a tick -would- be an example, because now they have an easier defense than what you guys accomplished by holding almost the entire meter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An example of an asymmetrical win condition is when both teams complete the map, one completes in overtime and the other finishes with a minute and 1 second left. The latter team has to only touch the point to cap even a little bit of it. Defending that is way harder than completing the map with a minute and one second left, so it feels horrible because the stakes are pointlessly stacked against the team that finished in overtime.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg6hymh", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492057517.0, "created_utc": 1492028717.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"author_cakeday": true, "subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wqg6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wqg6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wqg6", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64wqg6", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg5utpu", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "MaturestAdult", "parent_id": "t1_dg5qeyo", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "That only applies for the second point.
