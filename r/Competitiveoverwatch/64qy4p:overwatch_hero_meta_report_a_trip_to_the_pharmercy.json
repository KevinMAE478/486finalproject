&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;word&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;quot;tier&amp;quot;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;for&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;some&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;reason&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tiers/Usage Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucio Talk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As usual, Lucio was a near-unanimous lock on all game modes in all regions. That\u2019s\u2026not very exciting to talk about, but what is exciting is the potential for change on the horizon. The PTR has been down for some time and a new Overwatch event was recently leaked \u2013 hinting that the rework to Lucio\u2019s aura abilities may come sooner rather than later. Pro opinion is mixed: some think it\u2019s going to usher back in a tank-based meta, since the aura will no longer be able to support deeper diving heroes present in dive comps, but others think the changes are at least a step in the right direction to making the hero feel more engaging to play. I\u2019m personally a fan of anything that changes Lucio, but I\u2019d rather Blizzard release another hero entirely that makes Lucio less essential. Soundquake with a group speed boost too perhaps? But enough about Lucio\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Return of PharMercy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PharMercy is back, baby. But why now? The key is two different patch notes that occurred over the past two months:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCpj3akIuJ.png\"&gt;Feb 28 patch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The change to Mercy\u2019s Resurrection came alongside the \u201cOmnic Crisis\u201d version of Bastion, so few non-Mercy players even noticed it because they were busy dodging immortal, unfeeling, killing machines. Extending the invulnerability Mercy provides to her teammates upon resurrecting made using her ultimate much less of a suicide mission \u2013 although this change alone was not enough to noticeably increase her usage in the pro scene. Ana, Lucio, and to a lesser extent Zenyatta were still stronger options for the lineups of the time, so even with a buff to Mercy\u2019s ultimate, she would have had to become a \u201cbetter\u201d option than the other three healers. Unfortunately, this was not yet the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCpn3vOOLJ.png\"&gt;Mar 21 patch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then came the Ana patch two weeks ago, nerfing her damage from 80 to 60. This change\u2019s ripple effects have spread throughout the Overwatch cast, changing the way pros approach building a lineup. No longer can 200 HP heroes be taken out by three scoped-in hitscan shots from a skilled Ana. After this change and all of the nerfs up to this point, Ana\u2019s position in the meta seems to have finally come into question. There\u2019s evidence that this change was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back as well: the last two weeks of Apex were played on the pre-Ana nerf patch, and just look at the difference in regional hero usage:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCsMjoXch2.png\"&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The damage nerf had a Mercy-relevant effect on the landscape of Overwatch: the skies became a much safer place for Pharah, one such 200 HP hero. It\u2019s not any harder to hit a Pharah, but now that it takes four shots instead of three she has a better chance of reaching safety or being healed back to full. And guess what hero does the best job keeping Pharah topped off? If Pharah returns to the meta, Mercy\u2019s superior mobility relative to Zenyatta and Ana also comes into play. So let\u2019s review:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mercy\u2019s Resurrect is buffed, directly increasing her general viability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ana\u2019s damage is nerfed, directly decreasing her viability and indirectly making Mercy more viable by chipping away at lineup slots otherwise occupied Ana&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ana\u2019s damage nerf indirectly makes Pharah more viable, also indirectly helping Mercy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharah\u2019s increase in usage allows Mercy to make full use of her mobility potential, exposing Zenyatta and Ana\u2019s lack of mobility&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like a track of dominoes, all of these things have combined to bring Mercy back into the fore. PharMercy flies once again!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would like to caution my readers, however: since this report is based off of data gathered from hero usage in professional tournaments, be careful dusting off your Caduceus Staff and heading out into ranked play. Without a Pharah friend to support, you might be asking to get flamed \u2013 not because you deserve it \u2013 but because it has been so long since Mercy was relevant in the pro scene. This could be a transient change in the meta anyway: notice that Pharah and Mercy saw most of their play on king of the hill maps and not escort or payload. The nature of these maps makes a Pharah pick much stronger than usual, since there is plenty of high cover to hide behind, ledges to knock people off of, and short paths back from the respawn room to return to action. We will have to see if this trend continues to spread to non-KotH matches as well as the meta moves forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The rest of the Heroes&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. As exciting as Pharah and Mercy returning to pro tournament play was, a third of Overwatch\u2019s heroes had more play than Pharah, and half had more play than Mercy. Excusing the seven Korean matches from the Apex finals since they were played on a previous patch, the NA and EU teams have begun to play a diverse set of lineups. Teams ran 2/2/2 comps, triple tank, and dive, to varying degrees of success. In terms of hero picks, I noticed some interesting trends for various heroes and sub-maps this week. Reminder that clicking on the boxes will filter the \u201cWho played this hero\u201d box below, and mousing over the hero gives more detailed information. First, what the heck was going on with Tanks and escort maps this week?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCqbOeQa7d.png\"&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/OverwatchHeroMetaReport-PITGroupsApex/HeroUsageSummary?:embed=y&amp;amp;:display_count=yes\"&gt;Direct Link to Chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Splitting this out by teams instead of heroes, we can see that this was probably due to a lot of the NA teams running non-Dive comps into the Winston-only, undefeated Dive Comp of Rogue:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCqdCvisCi.png\"&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/views/OverwatchHeroMetaReport-PITGroupsApex/TeamWinsSummary?:embed=y&amp;amp;:display_count=yes\"&gt;Direct Link to Chart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rogue\u2019s pressure on the \u201csuccessful hero meta\u201d also accounts for some of the relative success seen by Genji in general:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCqe5KCZAx.png\"&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But teams that played Genji on King of the Hill maps also won more than they lost as well, without the help of Rogue \u2013 Nepal Sanctum shown for example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCqh5AD6xZ.png\"&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another strange trend was that almost all of the assault maps had a negative winrate on them \u2013 how could that be?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCqlCJIsRv.png\"&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s actually because two separate draws occurred this week: once on Hanamura and once on Volskaya. Draws are not wins, so they count against winrate in my system. I thought it was worth noting that of the six times Mei was picked on defense on 2CP maps played, she won four of those matches. I\u2019m surprised western pros don\u2019t stick with her more often: she\u2019s much more popular (at least, in a relative sense) in Korea than here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCqukyYtC9.png\"&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, maybe Mei &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; bae?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Thoughts / Shoutouts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I said it &lt;a href=\"https://www.overbuff.com/blog/2017-04-09-11-plays-you-might-have-missed-during-the-apex-grand-finals\"&gt;in my Apex Plays article&lt;/a&gt; and I&amp;#39;ll say it again here, shouto&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey Reddit, CaptainPlanet here!

That\u2019s\u2026not very exciting to talk about, but what is exciting is the potential for change on the horizon. The PTR has been down for some time and a new Overwatch event was recently leaked \u2013 hinting that the rework to Lucio\u2019s aura abilities may come sooner rather than later. Pro opinion is mixed: some think it\u2019s going to usher back in a tank-based meta, since the aura will no longer be able to support deeper diving heroes present in dive comps, but others think the changes are at least a step in the right direction to making the hero feel more engaging to play. I\u2019m personally a fan of anything that changes Lucio, but I\u2019d rather Blizzard release another hero entirely that makes Lucio less essential. Soundquake with a group speed boost too perhaps? But enough about Lucio\u2026\n\n---\n\n## **The Return of PharMercy**\n\nPharMercy is back, baby. But why now? The key is two different patch notes that occurred over the past two months:\n\n# [Feb 28 patch](https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCpj3akIuJ.png)\n\nThe change to Mercy\u2019s Resurrection came alongside the \u201cOmnic Crisis\u201d version of Bastion, so few non-Mercy players even noticed it because they were busy dodging immortal, unfeeling, killing machines. Extending the invulnerability Mercy provides to her teammates upon resurrecting made using her ultimate much less of a suicide mission \u2013 although this change alone was not enough to noticeably increase her usage in the pro scene. Ana, Lucio, and to a lesser extent Zenyatta were still stronger options for the lineups of the time, so even with a buff to Mercy\u2019s ultimate, she would have had to become a \u201cbetter\u201d option than the other three healers. Unfortunately, this was not yet the case.\n\n# [Mar 21 patch](https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCpn3vOOLJ.png)\n\nThen came the Ana patch two weeks ago, nerfing her damage from 80 to 60. This change\u2019s ripple effects have spread throughout the Overwatch cast, changing the way pros approach building a lineup. No longer can 200 HP heroes be taken out by three scoped-in hitscan shots from a skilled Ana. After this change and all of the nerfs up to this point, Ana\u2019s position in the meta seems to have finally come into question. There\u2019s evidence that this change was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back as well: the last two weeks of Apex were played on the pre-Ana nerf patch, and just look at the difference in regional hero usage:\n\n# [Image](https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCsMjoXch2.png)\n\nThe damage nerf had a Mercy-relevant effect on the landscape of Overwatch: the skies became a much safer place for Pharah, one such 200 HP hero. It\u2019s not any harder to hit a Pharah, but now that it takes four shots instead of three she has a better chance of reaching safety or being healed back to full. And guess what hero does the best job keeping Pharah topped off? If Pharah returns to the meta, Mercy\u2019s superior mobility relative to Zenyatta and Ana also comes into play. So let\u2019s review:\n\n- Mercy\u2019s Resurrect is buffed, directly increasing her general viability\n\n- Ana\u2019s damage is nerfed, directly decreasing her viability and indirectly making Mercy more viable by chipping away at lineup slots otherwise occupied Ana\n\n- Ana\u2019s damage nerf indirectly makes Pharah more viable, also indirectly helping Mercy\n\n- Pharah\u2019s increase in usage allows Mercy to make full use of her mobility potential, exposing Zenyatta and Ana\u2019s lack of mobility\n\nLike a track of dominoes, all of these things have combined to bring Mercy back into the fore. PharMercy flies once again!\n\nI would like to caution my readers, however: since this report is based off of data gathered from hero usage in professional tournaments, be careful dusting off your Caduceus Staff and heading out into ranked play. Without a Pharah friend to support, you might be asking to get flamed \u2013 not because you deserve it \u2013 but because it has been so long since Mercy was relevant in the pro scene. This could be a transient change in the meta anyway: notice that Pharah and Mercy saw most of their play on king of the hill maps and not escort or payload. The nature of these maps makes a Pharah pick much stronger than usual, since there is plenty of high cover to hide behind, ledges to knock people off of, and short paths back from the respawn room to return to action. We will have to see if this trend continues to spread to non-KotH matches as well as the meta moves forward.\n\n---\n\n# The rest of the Heroes\n\nLet\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. As exciting as Pharah and Mercy returning to pro tournament play was, a third of Overwatch\u2019s heroes had more play than Pharah, and half had more play than Mercy. Excusing the seven Korean matches from the Apex finals since they were played on a previous patch, the NA and EU teams have begun to play a diverse set of lineups. Teams ran 2/2/2 comps, triple tank, and dive, to varying degrees of success. In terms of hero picks, I noticed some interesting trends for various heroes and sub-maps this week. Reminder that clicking on the boxes will filter the \u201cWho played this hero\u201d box below, and mousing over the hero gives more detailed information. First, what the heck was going on with Tanks and escort maps this week?\n\n# [Image](https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCqbOeQa7d.png)\n\n# [Direct Link to Chart](https://public.tableau.com/views/OverwatchHeroMetaReport-PITGroupsApex/HeroUsageSummary?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=yes)\n\nSplitting this out by teams instead of heroes, we can see that this was probably due to a lot of the NA teams running non-Dive comps into the Winston-only, undefeated Dive Comp of Rogue:\n\n# [Image](https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCqdCvisCi.png)\n\n# [Direct Link to Chart](https://public.tableau.com/views/OverwatchHeroMetaReport-PITGroupsApex/TeamWinsSummary?:embed=y&amp;:display_count=yes)\n\nRogue\u2019s pressure on the \u201csuccessful hero meta\u201d also accounts for some of the relative success seen by Genji in general:\n\n# [Image](https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCqe5KCZAx.png)\n\nBut teams that played Genji on King of the Hill maps also won more than they lost as well, without the help of Rogue \u2013 Nepal Sanctum shown for example:\n\n# [Image](https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCqh5AD6xZ.png)\n\nAnother strange trend was that almost all of the assault maps had a negative winrate on them \u2013 how could that be?\n\n# [Image](https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCqlCJIsRv.png)\n\nIt\u2019s actually because two separate draws occurred this week: once on Hanamura and once on Volskaya. Draws are not wins, so they count against winrate in my system. I thought it was worth noting that of the six times Mei was picked on defense on 2CP maps played, she won four of those matches. I\u2019m surprised western pros don\u2019t stick with her more often: she\u2019s much more popular (at least, in a relative sense) in Korea than here:\n\n# [Image](https://www.overbuff.com/blobs/1mCqukyYtC9.png)\n\nAs it turns out, maybe Mei **is** bae?\n\n---\n\n# **Final Thoughts / Shoutouts**\n\nI said it [in my Apex Plays article](https://www.overbuff.com/blog/2017-04-09-11-plays-you-might-have-missed-during-the-apex-grand-finals) and I'll say it again here, shouto", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Esports | Analysis", "id": "64qy4p", "gilded": 1, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 305, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Falcon_Kick", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_64qy4p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.Competitiveoverwatch", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/piD63qY5pCxLz50dfZg8h6FW-ssiGeiplqhTrYc0CdA.png?s=6fde442a8d4a44d946cd8c709935e9ac", "width": 747, "height": 134}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/piD63qY5pCxLz50dfZg8h6FW-ssiGeiplqhTrYc0CdA.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=941d8a7814834dc0b07fc2fc6b972a94", "width": 108, "height": 19}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/piD63qY5pCxLz50dfZg8h6FW-ssiGeiplqhTrYc0CdA.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=19c8ebcaf884e3ef3d2d0cfc3554eac3", "width": 216, "height": 38}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/piD63qY5pCxLz50dfZg8h6FW-ssiGeiplqhTrYc0CdA.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=da25f30e60c967b3d0a7ef0e210761b9", "width": 320, "height": 57}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/piD63qY5pCxLz50dfZg8h6FW-ssiGeiplqhTrYc0CdA.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=861a5f883488c321fc3364830d41eaa7", "width": 640, "height": 114}], "variants": {}, "id": "IiBvSUdwteBY-3zAknivzsWfocrdy1zfVnrGMDXC2ww"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "edited": 1491927906.0, "link_flair_css_class": "Esports", "author_flair_css_class": "rank bronze", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "self", "is_self": true, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/64qy4p/overwatch_hero_meta_report_a_trip_to_the_pharmercy/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491947693.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/64qy4p/overwatch_hero_meta_report_a_trip_to_the_pharmercy/", "author_flair_text": "Meta Report Guy (@CaptainPlanetOW)", "quarantine": false, "title": "Overwatch Hero Meta Report: A Trip to the PharMercy", "created_utc": 1491918893.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 275, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 305}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qy4p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qy4p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qy4p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qy4p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qy4p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qy4p", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg6diis", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 3, "report_reasons": null, "author": "YahwehNoway", "parent_id": "t1_dg5wzay", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "yea he can hit a dash/melee but thats it.

All they have to do is EMP and self-destruct.\n&gt;Team 1, because they can't leave the point for more than a few seconds, are forced to fight through these ults, possibly dying, or run and give up space and possibly lose right there. They are at a massive disadvantage and will almost certainly lose.\n&gt;\n&gt;Team 1 could have done this tactic during their attack phase and built up 24% instead of 9%. However, this would require an investment of minutes and may not be an optimal strategy - it's great at getting 24%, but the team's unlikely to get a full capture with this strategy. If Team 1 chooses to do this, Team 2 knows that they need 25% of the point and can come up with a strategy for that or pick one that is good at full capturing, even if it's not a guaranteed 24% like the Sombra-D.Va combo is.\n&gt;\n&gt;The problem is that the second team to attack knows how much they need to capture, and can choose a strategy from the start that is good at getting the percentage needed even if it sucks at full capturing. The first team to attack always needs to go for full capture, even if they spare a push to get 9% with a flanker.\n&gt;\n&gt;This problem can mostly be solved by requiring a set amount of the bar to be filled before it counts as a win - that is, you need to capture at least 1 tick before you can get a win off it. Or, just use ticks as mini-points.\n\nAnd another:\n&gt;The second team to attack can, for their entire 4 minutes, run a strategy tailor made for the win condition they know they have. They know they don't need a full capture so they can spend 4 minutes running a comp that is great at getting 11% of the point.\n&gt;\n&gt;The first team to attack doesn't have this luxury. They HAVE to go for the full capture and, at some point, waste a push attempting to build up a buffer percentage.\n&gt;\n&gt;The first attack team can never run a comp that, with ults built up, is amazing at getting 20% of the point but sucks at full capturing. The second team to attack will be able to do this sometimes.\n&gt;\n&gt;If this goes live, at high levels you'll start seeing cheese strategies on attack for 2CP - but only ever by the second team to attack. Know you only need 14% to win? Run Roadhog, Mei, D.Va and Winston. Who cares if that team will never win a full capture - you just save ults and are virtually guaranteed a win.\n\nIf this change applies to Hybrid (I think it does, not positive though), it'll impact hybrid similarly but a bit less so.\n\nIt doesn't really apply to pure payload because:\n\n- 1.

Payloads tend to be in front of the defending team, while Capture Points are behind them. If a payload is right up against the winbox, the defending team will play on it and due to the nature of the maps this *typically* isn't nearly as suboptimal as holding back on Eichenwalde or Hanamura. Payloads *usually* have a certain amount of \"free push\" which grants a buffer for the defending team, and this buffer resets as the payload moves backwards after a successful defense - they can see the payload coming and thus it's not vulnerable to an invisible Sombra cap.\n\nThe idea of the second attack team having perfect knowledge of their goal still applies and always has, so first first defense / second attack may still have an advantage but its much less of an issue in this game", "edited": 1492003502.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll copy and paste a previous post of mine that illustrates, I think, why the new system is a poor design choice:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a specific scenario.\nTeam 1 attacks first.

Defense favors versatility (comps that aren&amp;#39;t easily countered) due to the inability to swap heroes without risking losing a point.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe I&amp;#39;m wrong here though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg4hwox", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491956724.0, "created_utc": 1491927924.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 20}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qy4p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qy4p", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg663zx", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ItWasLitFamJFK", "parent_id": "t1_dg4hzrw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Mei zones out Winston and Genji with her primary fire", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mei zones out Winston and Genji with her primary fire&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg663zx", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492045414.0, "created_utc": 1492016614.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg4hzrw", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "iCrackster", "parent_id": "t1_dg4go02", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "She's immobile, and when you have heroes such as Winston and genji getting picked consistently, it makes her wall relatively useless as they can just jump over it.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;s immobile, and when you have heroes such as Winston and genji getting picked consistently, it makes her wall relatively useless as they can just jump over it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg4hzrw", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1491956819.0, "created_utc": 1491928019.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 5}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qy4p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qy4p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qy4p", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_34fcy", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_64qy4p", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dg69rw3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "ItWasLitFamJFK", "parent_id": "t1_dg66llb", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Yes I know wall is used for picks, but blocking a soldier, Roadhog, or Zarya ult is massive and doesn't mean your losing.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes I know wall is used for picks, but blocking a soldier, Roadhog, or Zarya ult is massive and doesn&amp;#39;t mean your losing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Competitiveoverwatch", "name": "t1_dg69rw3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492049109.0, "created_utc": 1492020309.0, "depth": 4, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dg66llb", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Shammyhealz", "parent_id": "t1_dg6664w", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Competitiveoverwatch", "controversiality": 0, "body": "&gt; She slows and freezes people so your other dps can get kills faster\n\nFor us normal players, that's pretty good.
