Reply if you want, feel free to add anything or your own rewatch observations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In rewatch, I noticed how overt Barney actually was with his love/pining for Robin and how much more forward he was about that than Ted, who figuratively &amp;quot;sulked&amp;quot; around for literal years after he and Robin broke up, waiting for any &amp;quot;in&amp;quot; he thought would win her back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Barney can sense Ted/Robin&amp;#39;s incompatibility in S2 and mentions it a ton, even though he&amp;#39;s surprised when they do actually break up. Like he didn&amp;#39;t expect them to realise it. More Barney development was needed here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As far back as season one, Barney knew what a good match he and Robin were.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Barney cannot view their S3 hookup as meaningless no matter how hard he tries.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Barney sees Robin when his life flashes before his eyes after he&amp;#39;s hit by the bus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Post-Robin Ted rushes into marriage with the first serious relationship he finds.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Barney admits by 401 that he loves Robin (about 3-4 months after their hook up).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Late S4 Robin is not in a good way (Woo girl and naked man) while late S4 Barney is certain he wants Robin (resulting in his taking The Leap for her in the season finale). Robin notes &amp;quot;I am scared of how much I like you&amp;quot; and blurts out &amp;quot;lets get married&amp;quot;! Her reservations come from his womanizing (understandable!) and her low self esteem. Again, more character development for Robin was needed here.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Barney and Robin did not want to break up. They were pressured by their friends to date traditionally and it drove them apart. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Barney says his jealousy over Don is only about wanting to hook up with Robin again, but he refers to her as &amp;quot;Robin Stinson&amp;quot; and wants to meet Don. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ted, post Stella, is very cold/emotionless with relationships in S5 and is basically the &amp;quot;slides into your DMs&amp;quot; guy by the end of the season, letting Robin move back in (WHY) and almost hooking up with her til she stops it. Like how fucking irresponsible...&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;By the beginning of S6, Barney and Robin&amp;#39;s wedding is on the cards so every current event is shaping that future. Barney experiences serious relationships (Nora and Quinn) but throughout S6 shows visible interest/affection for Robin. Every other episode has a significant Barney and Robin moment. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Barney reconnecting with his dad is also littered with all these pining moments for Robin. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Kevin helps Robin realise she wants to settle down but she&amp;#39;s still stuck on &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; options like Kevin (or Ted...). Her initial angry reaction to Barney&amp;#39;s engagement play, followed by her immediate yes, says above all she was looking for solid commitment (which Kevin couldn&amp;#39;t promise) and she NEVER loved Ted (which is why Marshall pushes her to move out and Ted ends the &amp;quot;at 40&amp;quot; promise), get them both out of that unhealthy comfort cycle). The primary reason she got mad when Barney proposed was because it came from the playbook which was typically used for hookups only. She even says &amp;quot;You really think I could kiss you?&amp;quot;. It didn&amp;#39;t even occur that he&amp;#39;d be proposing marriage to HER so, once he did, everything she&amp;#39;d hoped for from Barney fell into place. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One episode of interest was S4&amp;#39;s Benefits. Originally, with Barney&amp;#39;s heartbreak over Robin and Ted hooking up, I thought it was the perfect episode to illustrate why they&amp;#39;d end up together. But looking back, they turned Robin into a moron for an episode, so she wouldn&amp;#39;t notice Barney&amp;#39;s love like EVERY other character did. The entitlement/audacity from Ted to use sex with Robin as a way to ignore their ongoing incompatibility was kinda gross. That montage where he talks about &amp;quot;jammin&amp;#39; on Scherbatsky&amp;quot; wtf. Barney having to physically destroy things to cope is disturbing outside of the running gag. Overall, it was a weird segue for Robin to have any desire to hook up emotionlessly with Ted, and for Ted to be OK with it as long as it was Sex With Robin (creepy pedestal worship). BUT - he realises his error! He comprehends that Barney has legitimate feelings for Robin and a superficial sex arrangement thrown in his face is tasteless so he stops (also bc they can&amp;#39;t help but blur the line between sex/relationship, hey it&amp;#39;s almost like they&amp;#39;re exes duh). So the writers had the self awareness to end that on a note that respected everyone (aside from Robin&amp;#39;s logic being misplaced for an episode) and yet this is the same team that wrote the heartless finale. I still think there were better ways to show Barney&amp;#39;s ongoing love for Robin that to have Ted and Robin randomly, coldly hook up almost as a joke, and shove it in everyone&amp;#39;s faces. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another episode that struck me was one I actually missed when it aired. I had trouble maintaining interest in season 8, Victoria and Klaus killed it for me. I ended up missing Romeward Bound completely, which is at the tail end of the season. I was browsing an old HIMYM forum and someone mentioned a moment of Ted/Barney tension in this episode. Intrigued, I watched it and was quite taken by the scene where Barney puts his foot down and will not even entertain Ted trying to give &amp;quot;best man advice&amp;quot; about Robin:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Context is Liddy is a hot woman with a bangin&amp;#39; body who is also Barney and Robin&amp;#39;s wedding planner)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barney:&lt;/em&gt; I can&amp;#39;t wait for my wedding day. I mean, there is no way that Liddy is gonna be wearing that coat, right? Right? &amp;quot;Barney Stinson, do you hope she wears something slinky and backless?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I do.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ted:&lt;/em&gt; Okay, can I just say something as your best man? Be careful. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barney:&lt;/em&gt; What do you mean? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ted:&lt;/em&gt; You just... you haven&amp;#39;t been acting like a guy who&amp;#39;s about to get married, and I know you think it&amp;#39;s okay because Robin&amp;#39;s so cool, but I&amp;#39;m telling you, she&amp;#39;s not as cool as you think she is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barney:&lt;/em&gt; Oh, I see. And you&amp;#39;d know this because you know Robin better than I do. You know what she appreciates better than her own fianc\u00e9. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ted:&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#39;m just saying, if I was getting married in three weeks... &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barney:&lt;/em&gt; But you&amp;#39;re not getting married in three weeks, Ted. I am. Robin&amp;#39;s marrying me, not you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ted:&lt;/em&gt; You&amp;#39;re right. Not my place. Why don&amp;#39;t I get the next round?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This moment is profound character development for Barney, and the type that was so painful to see washed away in the series finale. Barney heeded Tracey&amp;#39;s advice when he met her, he took every word she said 200% seriously. He wised up, grew up, became a winner, not a player, and got the girl of his dreams by putting it all on the line. Ted waited around and ran away until his destiny was all but given to him. It took so much, so many &amp;quot;lasts&amp;quot; to get him to let go of the Robin fantasy, to the point of her husband in his face saying &amp;quot;BACK OFF ALREADY&amp;quot; and still...he still pursues this woman...still tracks down that awful locket. Beyond creepy. The catch is, in Romeward Bound, it&amp;#39;s TED who points out the woman&amp;#39;s amazing body to Barney, talks up her hotness and - even after Robin shows approval for the woman&amp;#39;s body too - he still tries to talk down to Barney (about ROBIN, no less). Barney&amp;#39;s stance is reinforced/supported by the writers in the final scene, where he comes home to Robin and they roleplay the same situation with the coat. They found something that works for them without either changing for one another. Ted was out of line because he was judging based on what he doesn&amp;#39;t see.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This all, to me, leads to the finale&amp;#39;s biggest disservice. Erasing everything that made Robin&amp;#39;s life and personality her own. Barney leaves her inexplicably, Barney finds &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; love with his child, Robin achieves her dream job, but it&amp;#39;s deemed &amp;quot;not enough&amp;quot; to make her truly happy, she pines for Ted once &lt;em&gt;he&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; happy, she moves back to her old apartment (?!?). They forced Robin into regression, they took Barney completely out of her life and about the only thing they kept going with was Ted&amp;#39;s possessiveness over her being his only endgame.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I didn&amp;#39;t expect Ted to be alone for the rest of his days after Tracey, or that he shouldn&amp;#39;t listen to his kids telling him to go for it. That is fine, but the thing that gets me is it renders scenes like Barney in Romeward Bound completely useless. Scenes like Barney getting Ted&amp;#39;s blessing for his engagement (which if you think about it, was Barney going out of his way to get approval he REALLY didn&amp;#39;t need from &lt;em&gt;Ted&lt;/em&gt; of all people, but doing it for the importance of friendship). Scenes like the &amp;quot;pit&amp;quot; where Ted realises he&amp;#39;s only trapping himself. These scenes meant a LOT in first viewing. They brought the show up a notch from average, meaningless sitcom into something of a comedy/drama. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: It&amp;#39;s still a real shame to see the show&amp;#39;s creators so bizarrely regress the story at the last minute, at a complete disservice to the characters they created.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I've been rewatching lately and felt like laying some stuff out.

I know I'm overanalysing a sitcom but it was shitty of Lily (and Marshall) to push coupledom on two people who intensely guarded their feelings. \n\n&gt; He felt guilty for hooking with robin,why?because of ted(also the bro code)\n\nYes but when Robin first says \"This never happened okay?\" he's lying in bed saying \"This never happened...this never happened...\" then can't convince himself to see it that way. And like I said within a few months he realises he's in love with her. The guilt was ridiculous anyway since Ted had broken up with Robin ages ago. Robin is not his property.\n\n&gt; Yes he fell in love with her.What did he right after that?Again going back to his womanizing ways.And also tried to hookup with robin on ted's wedding,when she was emotionally vulnurable,that's actually disgusting\n\nIt's been a while since you watched the show, hasn't it? He tried to go on a date with Robin and she didn't see it that way, so he slipped back into his old ways as self preservation (he gives that bimbo speech to Lily then when she leaves he watches Robin on TV). When Ted and Robin hook up he's thrown for a loop. The wedding hookup attempt was messy, sure, but like they both openly admit they're bad at relationships in the season finale. \n\n&gt; These two points contradict each other.\n\nNo they don't lol Ted settled for Stella despite barely knowing her. The dude who is supposedly all about finding the perfect girl took the first one who would have him. And got burned for it too btw. He found someone also trying to run away from leftover feelings for an ex. \n\n&gt; Really??They were pathetic together.No relationship taking,the way try to solve a conflict(robin being naked and barney walks out).They don't talk before making plans(s09e07 No Questions Asked).Most importantly they don't understand each other.And the gang tried to break them up because more pathetic day by day(relationship chicken,robin even get annoyned by barney's voice)and they both were stubborn to admit it.Finally they break up without anybody's inteference\n\nYou're missing the point. I'm saying they broke off because they felt forced into that boyfriend/girlfriend role before either were ready. So all that bad stuff happened because they felt pressured to be a certain type of couple. They even put on the appearance of perfection just to appease their friends. Barney even mentions the lack of boundaries they all have in his *proposal to Robin*.\n\n&gt; Because he care for her unlike barney who used their breakup for further enjoyement (perfect week). And which show are you watching??She was the one try to make move on him and he was the one tried to stop it(he react by saying we drink a lot).\n\nYou really thought perfect week was a good thing?

They both wanted, and went for, something casual. Then their friends literally forced them to conform to being partners and the fighting started. They were &lt;em&gt;locked in a room&lt;/em&gt; for a day because they were nervous about commitment. I know I&amp;#39;m overanalysing a sitcom but it was shitty of Lily (and Marshall) to push coupledom on two people who intensely guarded their feelings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;He felt guilty for hooking with robin,why?because of ted(also the bro code)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes but when Robin first says &amp;quot;This never happened okay?&amp;quot; he&amp;#39;s lying in bed saying &amp;quot;This never happened...this never happened...&amp;quot; then can&amp;#39;t convince himself to see it that way. And like I said within a few months he realises he&amp;#39;s in love with her. The guilt was ridiculous anyway since Ted had broken up with Robin ages ago. Robin is not his property.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes he fell in love with her.What did he right after that?Again going back to his womanizing ways.And also tried to hookup with robin on ted&amp;#39;s wedding,when she was emotionally vulnurable,that&amp;#39;s actually disgusting&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a while since you watched the show, hasn&amp;#39;t it? He tried to go on a date with Robin and she didn&amp;#39;t see it that way, so he slipped back into his old ways as self preservation (he gives that bimbo speech to Lily then when she leaves he watches Robin on TV). When Ted and Robin hook up he&amp;#39;s thrown for a loop. The wedding hookup attempt was messy, sure, but like they both openly admit they&amp;#39;re bad at relationships in the season finale. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;These two points contradict each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No they don&amp;#39;t lol Ted settled for Stella despite barely knowing her. The dude who is supposedly all about finding the perfect girl took the first one who would have him. And got burned for it too btw. He found someone also trying to run away from leftover feelings for an ex. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Really??They were pathetic together.No relationship taking,the way try to solve a conflict(robin being naked and barney walks out).They don&amp;#39;t talk before making plans(s09e07 No Questions Asked).Most importantly they don&amp;#39;t understand each other.And the gang tried to break them up because more pathetic day by day(relationship chicken,robin even get annoyned by barney&amp;#39;s voice)and they both were stubborn to admit it.Finally they break up without anybody&amp;#39;s inteference&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re missing the point. I&amp;#39;m saying they broke off because they felt forced into that boyfriend/girlfriend role before either were ready. So all that bad stuff happened because they felt pressured to be a certain type of couple. They even put on the appearance of perfection just to appease their friends. Barney even mentions the lack of boundaries they all have in his &lt;em&gt;proposal to Robin&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because he care for her unlike barney who used their breakup for further enjoyement (perfect week).

His fixation on Robin comes from two angles.  Well, three.  First, she's really attractive and generally a great person (especially early on).  So, hey, what's not to like?  But second, she comes to represent a potential for the kind of life Ted wants to have.  The problem becomes that, third, he cannot see *past* Robin to what life might look like otherwise, with someone else, and cannot think in an abstract sense, because....she's *right there, dude!*  And he came *so* close with her (in his mind -- in reality, not really).\n\nIt's really, really difficult to see past someone to whom you're *incredibly* attracted -- even if they are objectively wrong for you, or clearly don't feel about you the way you want them to -- especially if they are in your life on any regular basis. It's bad enough to have fixed in your mind the notion that someone is ideal for you because they're as close to your idea of \"perfect\" as you've come (but are, obviously, *not* perfect or else they'd have reciprocated your interest at the same level), but to have them around all the time?  Part of your friends group?  That's torture.  That makes it almost impossible to move on.\n\nSo, that's a big part of Ted's love.  I think for Ted, Robin is less Robin-as-Robin, and more Robin-as-representative-of-Ted's-ideal-woman.  Ted is as fixated on her as he is because he's invested her with all of the qualities of his ideal woman -- regardless of whether she actually has those qualities.  That and Ted (because he can't see past Robin) can't imagine anything outside of Robin, because her presence obscures everything.  So, he can't imagine \"Hey, what would it be like to find someone who has many of her qualities, but who also is affectionate and loving, rather than distant or \"My presence implies my love for you\" or whathaveyou?\"  He can't imagine \"What would it be like to find someone who is into a lot of the same stuff as me, and who appreciates my quirks, but who also is enthusiastic about the idea of having kids?\"  Basically, he's in love mostly with a fantasy version of Robin -- an *idea* of her, rather than Robin herself.  Or at least, the degree to which he's fixated on her is driven (in my opinion) by that extra factor, beyond just who Robin is as a person.\n\n\nI think a ton of Ted's behavior in the show is also driven by his notion that \"This is enough\" and \"I'll take what I can get.\"  For as much of a dreamer as he is, I think he's actually incapable or afraid to dream bigger than that, and take the bigger risk: that there may not actually be anyone \"better\" than Robin, and his quest for his ideal woman is a fruitless one.  It can be scary, if you've built up this notion of what perfection is and devoted a ton of time to pursuing it, to contemplate (A) \"What if I'm wrong?\" or (B) \"What if I never find it?\"  I think part of Ted's pursuit of Robin is based on not wanting to confront those questions.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think Ted&amp;#39;s love is...complicated.
