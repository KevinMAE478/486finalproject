This post is about security. For my take on Privacy, [look here](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/5ul2j5/what_do_you_douse_to_protect_your_privacy/ddvcjxd/).\n\nI setup family computers, and my family had a talent for always getting infected. I've finally gotten their machines to stay clean consistently. These have been the most important steps:\n\n* Keep your software up to date!\n\n* Make sure your everyday user account is not an administrator account, but a standard account. This alone would protect you against [94% of all vulnerabilities](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3173246/security/94-of-microsoft-vulnerabilities-can-be-easily-mitigated.html) that were disclosed in 2016\n\n* Remove all software you don't need or no longer use. Every new software increases your attack surface. It's best to start with a fresh Windows install.\n\n* Use a firewall that blocks everything from getting online by default until you whitelist specific software. Don't let things get online that don't absolutely need to. If you're not sure, block it and see whether anything breaks before you change your mind\n\n* Use your browser in a 3rd party sandbox, such as [Sandboxie](https://sandboxie.com/).  It's simple in concept: everything is contained in a sandbox which gets cleared once you're done so if you get infected (virus, ransomware...) it (probably) won't spread to the rest of your machine and can be easily undone. I don't know of a good open source alternative for Windows but maybe someone else does?\n\n* Use an adblocker in your browser and limit Javascript a bit because malicious ads and scripts are the primary source of browser-based infections. I recommend uBlock Origin in [medium block mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-medium-mode)\n\n* Besides browsing, phishing emails/messages are one of the biggest vectors of infection. Be suspicious of links and attachments in emails and chat messages especially if they are unexpected. *Definitely* be suspicious of a document that tries to execute macros or reach out to the internet: many of the infected docs do this to download malware\n\n* Besides browsing and phishing, malicious software voluntarily installed may be the biggest threat. Here you just have to be careful about everything you run; run it first inside the sandbox from above as a test. [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) service allows you to upload a file and scan it against many antivirus engines.\n\n* Use an advanced uninstaller.  These can do a much better job of undoing an install than the default Windows uninstaller. I've had good success with [Revo Uninstaller Pro](https://www.revouninstaller.com/) but there are [many more](https://www.lifewire.com/free-uninstaller-programs-2625188). The best ones have a function via which you can install another program while they observe all the changes made by that program during installation, so that they can undo those changes if need be.\n\n* Nothing beats an infection like regular backups. Have automated backups that would not be accessible to a virus: it's not enough for the only backup to be on a drive that you can read/write to at any time because the virus can corrupt it. A simple approach is to schedule a backup the same time every day (or couple of days), but do it to an external drive that has to be plugged in and is otherwise disconnected. Alternatively, use a cloud backup solution but be sure your files are private from the provider (encrypted locally first). Eg: [SpiderOak](https://spideroak.com/personal/spideroak-one), or [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/) paired with DropBox/OneDrive/GoogleDrive\n\n* I would avoid always-on 3rd party antivirus/malware because [they often increase your vulnerability](http://theconversation.com/as-more-vulnerabilities-are-discovered-is-it-time-to-uninstall-antivirus-software-61374) by opening new holes in your system; not to mention that malware that's capable of beating the other protections has probably already been tested against these antivirus before being released. Windows Defender is probably ok, though I don't use it\n\n* Pay attention to your router. It's the first line of defense on your network. Use a router that gets regular security update, keep it updated, change default logins and disable remote administration (you shouldn't be able to change router settings when you're away from home). Also be sure to [disable Universal Plug-n-Play](https://www.howtogeek.com/122487/htg-explains-is-upnp-a-security-risk/) (UPnP) in your router. This allows software to unilaterally (without your input) open up ports in your router's firewall. It was meant to make setting up software easy, but it's used by malware to drill holes in your network.\n\n* Limit insecure devices on your network, especially IoT devices because their manufacturers have shown [little regard for security](http://www.csoonline.com/article/3128805/internet-of-things/the-internet-of-insecure-things-thousands-of-internet-connected-devices-are-a-security-disaster-in.html); one infected device can infect the others on the network.", "edited": 1492286126.0, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security and Privacy overlap but they are very different goals.

If you absolutely need to run proprietary applications or games on Windows (I sometimes do), have a dedicated installation of Windows on a separate partition / HDD / computer. Full disk encryption on Linux partition can protect your files on Linux from malware that could infect Windows (excluding ransomware that can just re-encrypt data). Use Linux for everyday browsing, work etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "privacy", "name": "t1_dgduvwu", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492481198.0, "created_utc": 1492452398.0, "depth": 5, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgbfka5", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 1, "report_reasons": null, "author": "lllIIIlIlIlIlIll", "parent_id": "t1_dgbbaqt", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/privacy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Well said and I completely agree.
