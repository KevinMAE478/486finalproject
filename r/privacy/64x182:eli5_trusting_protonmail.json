It has a free tier to lower barrier of entry but generates revenue from paid accounts. \n\n&gt; how or why they wont they cannot see my emails, personal info, ip logs\n\nAnyone you interact with online sees your IP, or the IP of a proxy you use. This is necessary for them to know where to find you on the Internet. As for your data, this has to do with public key encryption. This basically means there is a key used to encrypt data (public key) and a matching key used to decrypt data (private key). PM and anyone else can have your public key at no risk to you because the only thing they can do with it is encrypt (scramble) data that was already available to them in cleartext.  The private key (used to decrypt) never leaves your computer and is derived from your password. So when you send an email to another PM user, the email is encrypted in your own browser using that other user's public key. Since the matching private key never left the other user's machine, PM can store the email but cannot decrypt it. Only after the other user downloads the data to his browser will he use his private key (derived from his password) to decrypt and read your message ([how it works...](https://medium.com/@vrypan/explaining-public-key-cryptography-to-non-geeks-f0994b3c2d5)). When receiving mail from say a gmail user, the mail is received in cleartext so PM could see that email. What it does though is encrypt it with your public key before storing, so it never hangs on to the cleartext. If a govt or hacker gets its hands on your inbox, without your private key there is no way to decrypt its contents.\n\n&gt; Just email wise, can I can receive emails from work for e.g, send emails to work and others who don't use it or have no idea how to decrypt it\n\nYes you can. However, mail between you and non-PM users is not end-to-end encrypted. The mail you send to work colleagues is sent in the clear so there is no need for them to decrypt it. This means that their email provider (eg: Google) can see that mail. The mail non-PM users send you is also cleartext, however PM will encrypt it with your public key before storage as I pointed out above, so that it could not reproduce the cleartext even if it wanted to.

Startup funds came from an &lt;a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/protonmail#/\"&gt;Indiegogo crowdfund campaign&lt;/a&gt; after the Snowden revelations. The company also won a grant from the Swiss govt for promoting privacy technologies (I think). PM is now setup as a self-sustaining business.
