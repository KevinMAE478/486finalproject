If it helps to add, I think it's worthwhile to make explicit that \"Android\" usually refers to two completely separate things.\n\n1. [**Android as an Open-Source Project (AOSP**)](https://source.android.com/) is 100% free and open source software. Its existence is a very good thing for the world. If you wanted to start your own company selling any sort of internet-connected device\u2014ATMs, security cameras, large-format displays (to convey information to the public, like inside airports or on billboards), or even your own smartphone with a custom operating system\u2014then Android gives you a huge base to build on top of. The base itself is extremely stable, secure, compatible, and easy to develop for; and being backed by Google, a huge amount of resources are being used to provide security updates, which is a very big deal (in a good way). From there, you can add on top whatever you'd like. Wikipedia lists all of the following mobile operating systems as being based on Android: Baidu Yi, CopperheadOS, CyanogenMod, Fira OS, Fire OS, Hive UI, Indus OS, LineageOS, MIUI, Nokia X platform, OPhone, Replicant, Ubuntu for Android, Yun OS.\n\n2. Mainstream Android on mainstream smartphones is where stuff starts to get ugly. When a company wants to sell an Android phone to the masses, they usually don't just develop their own new operating system based on Android (like when Amazon launched Fire OS with the first Amazon Fire Phone). Instead, Google swoops in and makes a partnership with them, and most noteworthy, the manufacturer ends up one way or another including [**Google Play Services**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play_Services), which is perhaps the primary bad thing about mainstream Android. Google Play Services is the base that Google uses to integrate all their stuff into a smartphone\u2014integrated Google software like Gmail and Google Maps, third-party software (through their curated Google Play Store), push notifications, etc. This is where all the Google tracking and advertising happens. On top of that, you have hardware manufacturers that simply don't care about the security of their devices. Fresh, secure updates are pushed to AOSP, but most phone manufacturers never bother to take those updates and include them in their own devices. (As /u/stickybranches mentioned, there is a lot of blame to be put on SoC manufacturers and others that make that process needlessly complicated and expensive, so that the end result is that the consumer is left with an out-of-date device.)\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n1. Google spends a lot of money to provide new features and security updates to a versatile, free, open-source operating system. Good!\n\n2. Google, cellular carriers, chipmakers, and OEMs do a complicated dance that pushes garbage, propriety software and spyware on consumers and leaves them with outdated, vulnerable devices.

Its existence is a very good thing for the world. If you wanted to start your own company selling any sort of internet-connected device\u2014ATMs, security cameras, large-format displays (to convey information to the public, like inside airports or on billboards), or even your own smartphone with a custom operating system\u2014then Android gives you a huge base to build on top of. The base itself is extremely stable, secure, compatible, and easy to develop for; and being backed by Google, a huge amount of resources are being used to provide security updates, which is a very big deal (in a good way). From there, you can add on top whatever you&amp;#39;d like. Wikipedia lists all of the following mobile operating systems as being based on Android: Baidu Yi, CopperheadOS, CyanogenMod, Fira OS, Fire OS, Hive UI, Indus OS, LineageOS, MIUI, Nokia X platform, OPhone, Replicant, Ubuntu for Android, Yun OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream Android on mainstream smartphones is where stuff starts to get ugly. When a company wants to sell an Android phone to the masses, they usually don&amp;#39;t just develop their own new operating system based on Android (like when Amazon launched Fire OS with the first Amazon Fire Phone). Instead, Google swoops in and makes a partnership with them, and most noteworthy, the manufacturer ends up one way or another including &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play_Services\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play Services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is perhaps the primary bad thing about mainstream Android. Google Play Services is the base that Google uses to integrate all their stuff into a smartphone\u2014integrated Google software like Gmail and Google Maps, third-party software (through their curated Google Play Store), push notifications, etc. This is where all the Google tracking and advertising happens. On top of that, you have hardware manufacturers that simply don&amp;#39;t care about the security of their devices. Fresh, secure updates are pushed to AOSP, but most phone manufacturers never bother to take those updates and include them in their own devices. (As &lt;a href=\"/u/stickybranches\"&gt;/u/stickybranches&lt;/a&gt; mentioned, there is a lot of blame to be put on SoC manufacturers and others that make that process needlessly complicated and expensive, so that the end result is that the consumer is left with an out-of-date device.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So to summarize:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google spends a lot of money to provide new features and security updates to a versatile, free, open-source operating system. Good!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, cellular carriers, chipmakers, and OEMs do a complicated dance that pushes garbage, propriety software and spyware on consumers and leaves them with outdated, vulnerable devices. Bad!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "privacy", "name": "t1_dgc6xa3", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492387397.0, "created_utc": 1492358597.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 3}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o59a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o59a", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcf14z", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "DonnyGitsGud", "parent_id": "t1_dgc29rw", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/privacy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "But why Google and not other Prism companys?\n\nDont say they started it either, they didnt join first.\n\nI personally hate Microsoft but not Google as the latter has done a lot of good for people.", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why Google and not other Prism companys?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dont say they started it either, they didnt join first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I personally hate Microsoft but not Google as the latter has done a lot of good for people.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "privacy", "name": "t1_dgcf14z", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492398142.0, "created_utc": 1492369342.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o59a", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2qhlc", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o59a", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgc7xz4", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 7, "report_reasons": null, "author": "thesynod", "parent_id": "t1_dgc6o01", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/privacy", "controversiality": 0, "body": "DuckDuckGo \"nestle baby formula\" and \"nestle water\"", "edited": false, "downs": 0, "body_html": "&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;DuckDuckGo &amp;quot;nestle baby formula&amp;quot;
