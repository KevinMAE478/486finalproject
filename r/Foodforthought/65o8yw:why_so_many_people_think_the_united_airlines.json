It&amp;#39;s not MADE to make things better for everyone involved: our system is hard-coded to elevate certain people over others, and if that core mechanic doesn&amp;#39;t work, you get total systemic collapse like we have now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be NICE to have a system that was future-proofed or even PLANNED to distribute things evenly to all people, to &amp;quot;make things better for all people&amp;quot;, but you cannot mount any sort of rational, evidential defense that that is the system we have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The minute we start having a deficit of people to export our shit and misery to is the minute the system collapses. Why do you think our legislature is totally deadlocked, non-functional? Why is our infrastructure collapsing? Why don&amp;#39;t we solve our national problems? Because the only tool America has EVER had for solving those problems was to make someone eat shit and die instead of us, and then pat ourselves on the back that they&amp;#39;re shit-eaters, and we don&amp;#39;t eat shit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t blame anyone in the modern day for not seeing this on their own, because they keep exporting the shit and misery further away, and covering it up with more entertainments. But there are a LOT of people out there trying to talk to you and realize that your system is indefensible, that it&amp;#39;s ALWAYS been a vicious, losing system, and it&amp;#39;s time to set it on fire ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "Foodforthought", "name": "t1_dgcbe4v", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492393279.0, "created_utc": 1492364479.0, "depth": 2, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 2}}, {"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rete", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o8yw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rete", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o8yw", "likes": null, "replies": {"kind": "Listing", "data": {"modhash": "", "children": [{"kind": "t1", "data": {"subreddit_id": "t5_2rete", "removal_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_65o8yw", "likes": null, "replies": "", "user_reports": [], "id": "dgcrtr3", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 2, "report_reasons": null, "author": "dougbdl", "parent_id": "t1_dgcnn7p", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Foodforthought", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Legalizing what are known as bribes elsewhere in the world, has changed the game so that influencing elected officials has no downside.
