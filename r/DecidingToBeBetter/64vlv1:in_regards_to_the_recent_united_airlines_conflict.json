Why are so many people entitled to thinking that they are better then everyone else around them? It is really surprising to me that NO ONE on the plane would give up their seat in exchange for another flight the next day.\nWhich brings me to my next point.

Instead of offering up your seat for the man, you take out your phone and film it instead!? What were you all thinking?
