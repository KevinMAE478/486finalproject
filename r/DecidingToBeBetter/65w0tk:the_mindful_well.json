Walking under the hot sun, he turned the focus of his attention to finding a source of hydration. He soon saw, not to far from him, what appeared to be a well. Eyes widened, \u201cWater!\u201d he exclaimed, running towards the well. A small wooden pale attached to a rope lay on the ground beside the well. The hiker grabbed the pale and leaned forward over the well looking down as deep as he could. Darkness, as far as his eyes could see. Holding the rope with one hand and the pale with another, he gently positioned the pale in the middle of the well and eased it down. Although he could not see the pale hit the water, he easily recognized the echoed sound of the pale gently touching the surface of the water and felt the weight of the pale pull is arms downwards as it began to fill. The hiker began pulling the pale back towards the surface. It had barely crossed the top of the well when he quickly grabbed it with both hands and leaned backwards prepared to drench himself with the water and drink it all at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cHold on Sir!\u201d, yelled a tiny voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Startled, the hiker dropped the pale in front of him, water drenching his shoes and legs as the pale hit the ground and lay there, now only half full.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWhat!? What is it?\u201d he yelled as if a loud BANG had just woken him from a deep sleep.\n\u201cYou were about to drink from the water of this well\u201d, replied a young girl.\n\u201cI am thirsty and have run out of water, yes\u2026of course I was!\u201d\n\u201cWell have you looked at the water? Have you taken the time to smell it? Have you examined it to see whether the water is clear or muddy?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hiker leaned over and picked up the pale now half as heavy as when he had first pulled it up. He looked into it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWell? Are there any objects in the water that may hurt you or make you sick? I\u2019m from around here, you should know, and we have many wells, but not all are fit for drinking. It may save you some future worries to not be to quick in drinking from any well.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed thirsty for water, the hiker hadn\u2019t stopped to think about such things which he now quietly thought to himself, \u201cUuuuh-hun, that seems reasonable\u201d.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cNo\u2026no I haven\u2019t.\u201d He answered. \u201cThanks for the heads up\u201d. The hiker took a moment, still looking into the pale, he looked closer into the water, gave it a long deep smell and tasted a bit of it on the tip of his tongue. The water was fresh, smelt clean and was impeccably clear. Now, more certain of the water\u2019s freshness and quality, the hiker not only drenched himself with it and drank from it, he offered some to the young girl as well. They both enjoyed the fresh water and, shortly after, parted ways both feeling satisfied, refreshed and replenished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2014&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thinking, either consciously or unconsciously is like lowering an empty pale into a deep well. The water at the bottom of the well is a pool of mixed thoughts living in the deepest places of our mind. Pulling up the pale filled with water is like pulling up thoughts to the surface of our active mind. Before consuming these thoughts and filling our body with them, it is wise to take pause. Take the time to observe and analyze the pale of thoughts you brought up to the surface. Are the thoughts clear? Are they muddied? Do they look and feel refreshing and replenishing? Would they hydrate you and give you life or could they possibly harm you and make you sick? Are they the kind of thoughts you would want to share with others in order to help them feel hydrated, refreshed, replenished and healthy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If so, drink freely from them. Share them with others so that they too may partake in the benefits of these thoughts. Otherwise, it is ok to simply pour the water over the side and empty the pale. It is not simply because you pulled the pale of thoughts from the well of your mind that these thoughts are necessarily the type that will refresh you or others around you. Not all thoughts you pull up from your well of thoughts serve you fully, provide you with a healthy mind and body and allow you to thrive. The only way to fully know this is to always take the time to observe and analyze the thoughts you pull up to the surface of your mind before quickly drenching yourself in them, consuming them and sharing them with others. Our bodies are made up of over 60% water. Thoughts we consume to quickly, much like the water we consume, are likely to end up being a big part of who we are. Taking the moment to analyze and observe these thoughts will allow you to better understand and identify your numerous wells and the many thoughts that rest therein. This practice in mindful observation will allow you to make better choices as to which thoughts make you, and possibly those around you, healthier and which thoughts, after analysis, you may choose to simply\u2026pour over the side.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While it may be true that not all thoughts brought to the surface are made for consumption and sharing, every single pale of thoughts we pull up to the surface provides us with the opportunity we all need to practice mindful observation and, when required, release.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "A young hiker noticed his water jug was near empty.
