I wish I had let myself be happier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When looking back at their lives many found that they were not as happy as they could have been. With age people tend to come to the realization that happiness ultimately is a choice. Happiness depends very much on your outlook of life more so than your outside circumstances. Outside circumstances can defiantly help! Getting a lambo will keep you happy for a while but there are more important metrics at play. Two people are often born into similar circumstances but can have varying levels of happiness. Happiness ultimately depends on your outlook on the events in your life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the final days of many people\u2019s lives they often looked back at their lost friendships. Many regretted not having stayed in contact with friends from years back, and often wondered what these friends were up to. It\u2019s easy to lose track of people in life, even those we swear we would never forget. We must remember to keep in touch with those friends that we connected with in the past to avoid this regret. So which friends of your friends is overdue a call?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. I wish I\u2019d had the courage to express my feelings.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The courage to express feelings honestly is one that is difficult for a lot of people. It\u2019s difficult because it often puts you in a vulnerable position, however the regret is often far worse in the end.\n\u2022 The regret of not telling someone we love that we love them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 The regret of not telling someone that how they treat us was unacceptable&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 The regret of not coming to terms with our sexuality &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 The regret of not coming to terms with our true personal beliefs&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are all examples of a lack of congruence with our feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. I wish I didn\u2019t work so hard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Working the 9-5 Monday-Friday for decades is bound to leave you jaded. Sometimes we take on extra hours at work just so that we can make more money, or obtain a more strategic position for promotion. We save money for the dream of retirement. For many of us it\u2019s constantly Hustle Hustle Hustle Hustle. The consequence is often one of regret at not enjoying life, not doing all the things we might have dreamed of. This regret is rather poignant because we can look back at all the hard work and think \u201cwhat for?\u201d Where are the memories of traveling the world? Learning new things? And having new experiences? They don\u2019t exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.    I wish I\u2019d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most heard regret was the regret of living a life based of other people\u2019s expectations. The regret of living a life that fit the \u2018socially conditioned narrative\u2019. Many outside influences tell us what we should do, and what is appropriate. These influences can suffocate us until we give in and follow what the herd is doing. Many of us&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Go to college because we are told to&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Get married before we are ready because our parents and friends will look down on us&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Buy things we don\u2019t necessary need&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\u2022 Get the Jobs we are not overly enthusiastic about&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All these things are done in order to fulfil the script. When we are on our death beds we start to have thoughts about \u2018what we could have done\u2019, and how life \u2018could have been\u2019, if we just had the courage to live life on our terms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THANK YOU FOR READING&lt;/strong&gt;\nSo those are the 5 most common regrets of the dying!
