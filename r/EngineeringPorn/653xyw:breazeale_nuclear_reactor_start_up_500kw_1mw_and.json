This means that for a sufficiently fast particle the visible light will peak in the blue-violet region of the spectrum.\n\n &amp;nbsp;\n\n&gt;That accounts for the blue color. Most of the \u00c7erenkov light from the fast electrons in water surrounding fuel rods will actually be invisible - it's in the UV region.\n\nSo as to why it's green in cartoons... Most likely it's because luminescent radium paint was an early widespread commercial application of a radioactive substance (on watches, clocks, etc.). It glows green.  It was used the same way that tritium vials (that also glow green) are used on watches and gun sights today.  That was many people's first real world interaction with radiation.\n\nAnother couple of reasons I can think of...  Yellow paint is often used on radiation/nuclear warning signs.  When the signs rusted, the red rust mixed with the yellow paint to form a green patina.

This means that for a sufficiently fast particle the visible light will peak in the blue-violet region of the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That accounts for the blue color.

Most likely it&amp;#39;s because luminescent radium paint was an early widespread commercial application of a radioactive substance (on watches, clocks, etc.). It glows green.  It was used the same way that tritium vials (that also glow green) are used on watches and gun sights today.
