(I&amp;#39;m a bot)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Imagine a future in which every home has an appliance that pulls all the water the household needs out of the air, even in dry or desert climates, using only the power of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The prototype, under conditions of 20-30 percent humidity, was able to pull 2.8 liters of water from the air over a 12-hour period, using one kilogram of MOF. Rooftop tests at MIT confirmed that the device works in real-world conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One vision for the future is to have water off-grid, where you have a device at home running on ambient solar for delivering water that satisfies the needs of a household,&amp;quot; said Yaghi, who is the founding director of the Berkeley Global Science Institute, a co-director of the Kavli Energy NanoSciences Institute and the California Research Alliance by BASF. &amp;quot;To me, that will be made possible because of this experiment. I call it personalized water.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/65s0ym/device_pulls_water_from_dry_air_powered_only_by/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extended Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\"http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/\" title=\"Version 1.65, ~103243 tl;drs so far.\"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\"http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31bfht/theory_autotldr_concept/\"&gt;Theory&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=\"http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr\" title=\"PM&amp;#39;s and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\"&gt;Feedback&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Top&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;keywords&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;water&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;#1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;MOF&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;#2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;air&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;#3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;#4&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;strong&gt;harvest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;#5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "EngineeringPorn", "name": "t1_dgcq6p9", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492412864.0, "created_utc": 1492384064.0, "depth": 0, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 1}}], "after": null, "before": null}}]
