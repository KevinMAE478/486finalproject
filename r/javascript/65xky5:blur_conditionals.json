My problem is that some of the pages have videos that are iframed from Vimeo, and anytime one of these is clicked it thinks that the window has changed and is submitting their work for trying to leave.  Is there a way to detect the source of the blur and whitelist certain targets?  Thanks in advance for any ideas you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "Hey guys, wondering if anybody has some ideas about what i can do on this.
