My weight has yoyo-ed between slim (for a brief period in high school) and round-looking but I was almost always the chubby kid. Recently, I made the decision to become better - I run and eat what I need, not what I want and generally move around more. So I tend to take the stairs or the longer route where possible. Momma refuses to walk too far because it&amp;#39;s tiring and by &amp;quot;too far&amp;quot; I mean the 5th floor in a mall with escalators.

Rice is a staple, at every meal. Drowning in oil, salty af and so much sugar in drinks and food! The worst part is the portions are so large and the prices are cheap - so it&amp;#39;s a financial bargain but I feel my insides rioting at the thought of it. Even the &amp;quot;light&amp;quot; meals are insane. If I had to say, most dishes are 350+ cals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My parents prefer to eat out for most meals. So take all the above and go figure. And they&amp;#39;re chronic snackers. Chips, nuts, these fried fish fritters, biscuits, fruit, whatever&amp;#39;s there - well, it won&amp;#39;t be for long. And snacking to her doesn&amp;#39;t count either!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When she does cook at home, it&amp;#39;s enough to feed a family of 8. There&amp;#39;s only 4 of us and my brother is a picky eater so technically 3 left to finish the food. I was raised to clean my plate because there are children who are starving - I was the human garbage disposal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time I tell her to cook less - our food isn&amp;#39;t the kind you want to have a lot of so leftovers tend to go bad - she acts like it&amp;#39;s a personal attack and ignores me.
