Trash cans. Our store is so big there\u2019s like 60 trash cans that need all need to be checked throughout the entirety of the store so it takes some time. I\u2019m heading down to the produce section to get the garbage there when I see her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUPA LADY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She looked at if she was about to assert a military strike. Her and Jenkins were blocking the front entrance to the store sitting on two scootypuffs side by side. Fupa Lady\u2019s eyes scanned the surrounding area getting ready to graze on all our food while she shopped for 4+ hours. With great power she drives her scootypuff forward first and tells Jenkins to split up to cover more ground. They started flanking the produce section from both sides. People were left to the wolves! I had to do something. I went in search for Shitlord Manager right away. The beetus had to be stopped!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time I found SM and told him of Fupa Lady\u2019s return everything was put on hold. It was time to confront this beast head-on. It was time for action and truth. No longer would I be forced to clean up her shitty mess she left on the toilet! No more would our free samples be robbed by her greedy hands! No more\u2026 K I think I\u2019m getting too obsessed with hyperbole here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways\u2026 SM and I go looking for Fupa Lady to confront her about the mess she made in &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/632n3y/chubby_custodian_chronicles_9_fupa_lady_bathroom/\"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt; She was hanging out at our Starbucks restaraunt sporting a stretchy over -saturated green shirt with expandable grey pants. Apparently she was having a meal with enough calories in it to feed the entire country of Kenya. Someone do the calorie count here for me: 1 box of pre-cooked mac &amp;amp; cheese, 2 boxes of store-bought and pre-cooked extra greasy fried chicken, 3 large blueberry muffins, a large chocolate frappucino, and a strawberry poundcake. That\u2019s right. A whole strawberry poundcake. That\u2019s what this woman was feeding herself for dinner at our Starbuck\u2019s restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me and SM approach the hambeast\u2019s horde. She cuts herself a massive slice of the poundcake and starts stuffing it in her mouth. When she sees the massive form of SM approach her she snaps her head around as cake crumbs fly from her lips onto the ground. Her mouth is stuffed to the limit with cake and her nose is putriding in an upward fashion. SM speaks:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SM: \u201cMa\u2019am did you use one of our unisex bathrooms by pharmacy last time you visited our store?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fupa Lady gulps down the massive piece of cake she ate. Jenkins sitting beside her takes note of how big SM is and starts calculating if the \u201col\u2019 1-2 and left hook\u201d would solve this situation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fupa Lady: \u201cProbably. Why what of it?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oh wow completely denying that she left a shitty mess twice that I had to clean up. Dang I\u2019m pissed. SM continues to do the talking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SM: \u201cDid you leave a horrible mess for this young man here to clean up?\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SM pointed to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fupa Lady: \u201cIt\u2019s probably his job to clean toilets anyways, it\u2019s all privileged hacks like him are good for.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A veins bursts out of SM\u2019s forehead, somewhere in world a lion kills its prey on the savannah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SM: \u201cMa\u2019am if your going to leave a mess like the one he described in our store twice I\u2019m afraid I will have to put an embargo in place for means of a health hazard to the rest of my customers.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fupa Lady now stuffing a fried chicken leg down her throat&lt;/strong&gt; \u201cYou believe what that kid says? He probably lies just to get more money out of you! Give him a pink slip already!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alright I was done playing beta&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: \u201cExcuse me you pig but I\u2019ll have you know I can actually walk around and do good work unlike yourself.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenkins sees his moment and bursts into action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jenkins: \u201cHey watch your mouth and show some respect! My wife\u2019s just big boned!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: \u201cI ain\u2019t showing no respect for someone who\u2019ll shit the equivalent of a bull elephant and leave me to clean it all up!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SM looks over to me and glares&lt;/strong&gt; \u201cChubby listen I think I saw a spill in aisle 19. Go clean it for me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I take that as a cue that I should just leave the rest of the talking to him and go on my merry way. I guess I said enough. I was done playing beta to that hog. After checking all the trash cans I notice Jenkins shove all the wrappers and empty boxes of the meal into the trash can. She really did it. I didn\u2019t think it was possible. She ate an entire &lt;a href=\"http://lilluna.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Strawberry-Pound-Cake-2-2.jpg\"&gt;poundcake&lt;/a&gt;! I guess I know why she has such sloppy shits now. SM walked over to me&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;SM: \u201cOh my. You would not believe that woman Chubby. She said the strawberry poundcake she was eating was so she got her daily dose of fruit.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: \u201cWhaddaya reckon we do about her boss?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SM: \u201cShe\u2019s using one of those old law techniques I forget what it\u2019s called. Saying we can\u2019t prove your story is true by only the fact that you witnessed it. Because you could just be lying.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to know me as your gym buddy SM would I lie to you?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SM: \u201cNo you wouldn\u2019t. &lt;strong&gt;Stares off into the distance as a dustball blows across the barren field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SM: \u201cBut we can\u2019t actually incriminate her wrongdoings without hard evidence.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: \u201cSo you\u2019re suggesting we lay a trap? How?\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SM: \u201cWhat she just digested. Literal cake and fried greasy crap. She\u2019s gonna have to take one hell of a sloppy shit no more than 2 hours from now.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Me: \u201cOh that\u2019s just peachy.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SM: \u201cYes but that\u2019s how we\u2019re gonna catch her.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time passes as I continue to do my job. SM tells me not to worry about anything. He\u2019ll take care of Fupa Lady. I double check all the bathrooms real quick and make sure they\u2019re all white and clean. I\u2019m approaching the pharmacy bathrooms when I see her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FUPA LADY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She\u2019s driving straight towards the unisex bathrooms by pharmacy! The nightmares I suffered cleaning her crap up last time WILL NOT BE REPEATED! Then I noticed a camera attached to the wall beside the unisex bathroom door. That camera wasn\u2019t there before! Did SM just install it? Were we going to catch the hambeast in her tracks? She stopped her scootypuff by the bathroom door and heaved herself off the chair. A massive waft of toxic gas spewed into the air. Climate change was accelerating just by the amount of methane secreting from this woman\u2019s body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She walks into the bathroom and locks the door. I\u2019m standing only 20 feet from the bathroom door. I decide to get a close look at that new camera. It was just mounted to the wall, not inside the bathroom no, but facing the bathroom door. SM is smart. He knew it would be stupid and even incriminating against us if we taped the hambeast defiling our property inside the bathroom. Plus the horrible imagery of what it looks like when she is taking one of her massive dumps. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I smell it. That kinda of smelly smell. The smelly smell that smells\u2026 Smelly\u2026&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The stench fills the air and I\u2019m forced to run away from the camera and take cover behind enemy lines. I had to reload my mop bucket with extra cleaner. Dreading what could lie beyond that bathroom door. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then Fupa Lady finally emerges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She gets back on her scootypuff and rides off to shop for more beetus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I approach the bathroom. I can smell it. Something died in here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://cdn.ebaumsworld.com/mediaFiles/picture/677709/80575555.jpg\"&gt;For any brave souls out there this is something of what the toilet looked like&lt;/a&gt; but imagine the shit piling up past the rim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn\u2019t clean it. I wouldn\u2019t clean it! I REFUSED! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cThis is a rebellion. I rebelled.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to take a picture of it with my phone then tape a sign to the bathroom door that just read \u201cOut of service\u201d. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I found SM he was helping an old lady out select some healthy pasta sauce for her spaghetti recipe. After his deed was done I informed him of the situation and showed him the picture on my phone. Then he showed me a picture on his phone of the toilet being white. But the final nail in the coffin was that, WE HAD TIMESTAMPS ON OUR PHOTOS! Couple this with the camera also and we have all the evidence we need to ban her from using our bathrooms. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By now Fupa Lady has spent over 3 hours shopping at our store. When me and SM go to find her again she wasn\u2019t hard to miss. She was loading her scootypuff up with cartons of butter by our dairy aisle. Jenkins was nowhere to be seen though. My guess is that Fupa Lady told him to pay for the first portion of bought food and return it home then come back to the store to join her in buying more food. Because after this conversation finished we found him riding a scootypuff into the store again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SM approaches Fupa Lady. I\u2019ve done enough hyperbole here I\u2019m sure you guys can imagine how the conversation went down. With the timestamps on our photos and the camera we had outside the bathroom door all Fupa Lady could say was she had \u201ccundishuns\u201d and this was \u201cdiskriminaeshun\u201d. But SM was not easily fooled. With one swift move he picked her up off the scootypuff and delivered an F5 like Brock Lesnar. Fupa Lady was kicked out of store and if she decides to return she will not be allowed to use our restrooms. SM phoned up a hazmat team. The team said they would be by tomorrow night to clean up her mess. The bathroom would remain closed until then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All in all, I am happy I will NEVER have to clean up after such a disgusting piece of shit THING ever again! But I\u2019m not sure though. This can\u2019t be the end of it. If Fupa Lady returns again will our forces be enough to withstand her wrath? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tune in next time folks! Same fat time. Same fat channel!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL; DR Fupa Lady eats enough food to feed a family of 4 then gets caught defiling store property again, and kicked out.
