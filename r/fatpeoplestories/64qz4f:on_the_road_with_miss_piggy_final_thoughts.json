I like to keep these things honest, but also keep story flow, so tacking this stuff on the end is just the easiest way to go here. Thank you again, everyone, for your support. I have enjoyed entertaining you, and have enjoyed all the responses. You&amp;#39;re a wonderful community.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payment:&lt;/strong&gt; As mentioned a few times in the stories, Miss Piggy had trouble paying her share to the joint travel card many times. She was regularly late, &amp;quot;forgot&amp;quot;, or &amp;quot;had to wait for transfers&amp;quot;. There was always an excuse, and she always had this vibe of defensiveness and frustration when we eventually forced her to pay her share. At the end of the trip, there was not enough money left on the card for Fozzie\u2019s car to be serviced. She and I discussed it and decided it would be fair if both Miss Piggy and I paid her a final $100 each to assist the bill. Miss Piggy was so emotionally volatile that despite me having already paid my share, Fozzie had to make another group chat and ask both of us for the money, and have me message her back in it to say \u201coh yes absolutely here it is now, thanks again we couldn\u2019t have done this trip without you this is the least we could do etc.\u201d We were sitting next to each other on the couch while we did this. But Fozzie was concerned, justifiably, that if she had asked Miss Piggy privately that she would have been ignored or refused. She needed me to put the pressure on once again. And, of course, it took Miss Piggy a week\u2019s worth of reminders to pay up. I am honestly shocked that she ended up paying her full 1/3 of the entire trip as I was expecting to have to cover her because of her attitude, and I attribute the success to Fozzie\u2019s no-nonsense responsibility drive she has from being a teacher. But I know for a fact if we didn\u2019t remind and harass Miss Piggy into paying, she would have happily lived off our backs and slept peacefully the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Car Damage:&lt;/strong&gt; If you recall from the first story, Fozzie\u2019s car was brand new. It was her baby and she begged us to be as careful as possible with it. By the end of the trip, the area around Miss Piggy\u2019s door was scratched to hell. I make a point of carrying things away from vehicles because I am clumsy as fuck, and I was paranoid about hurting the car, thereby making my best friend in this country sad or stressed. So I know it wasn\u2019t me. And Fozzie wouldn\u2019t ever do that to her own car, no way. But as usual, a certain someone was incapable of taking any kind of responsibility her her actions, so it is a \u201cmystery\u201d as to how those scratches occurred. On top of that, the back seat was &lt;em&gt;filthy.&lt;/em&gt; Old chocolate was ground into the seams of the leather, which was scuffed to hell, and there was first and sand and sticky stuff on every surface. Garbage all over the floor. Guess who cleaned it up? Not Miss Piggy, thats who. So much disrespect for other people\u2019s property, even knowing how important it was, and benefiting incredibly from using it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snout Problems:&lt;/strong&gt; Miss Piggy could &lt;em&gt;not keep her disgusting hooves out of her fucking nose.&lt;/em&gt; Every second time I looked at her she was picking, snorting, digging around. She would blow her nose &lt;em&gt;into her hand&lt;/em&gt; and then refuse tissues when Fozzie offered them, clearly missing the point of \u201cthis is so you don\u2019t get snot fingerprints on my precious car, please blow your nose into a goddam tissue.\u201d We had to remind her several times to use tissues. Like a bloody toddler. And no, she still never washed her hands, not even after using nasty gas station toilets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friendship Envy:&lt;/strong&gt; Miss Piggy undoubtedly became a third wheel on this trip, and despite you all understanding why that is, we suspect she took a great deal of offence to it. Aside the fact that neither Fozzie nor I wanted to share a room (or, often the case, a bed) with her due to the snout digging that carried on into the night, Fozz and I were just closer and more comfortable with each other. We both hardly knew Miss Piggy, but we\u2019d met on a tour in Europe and were roommates for 13 days sharing rooms and beds the entire time. It felt more normal for us to continue sharing those spaces with each other because we knew each other so well. Miss Piggy\u2019s disgusting habits and awkward grouchy attitude solidified this and on the rare occasions we\u2019d share with her, we were regretful. Miss Piggy had an opportunity from the start to get close to us, get to know us, connect with, and build a friendship. By all rights, she and I should have had the same kind of friendship at the end of the road trip as Fozzie and I had by the end of our Europe tour. But try as I might, she just didn\u2019t seem interested, and never made an effort to befriend me or invest in her friendship with The Fozz. And despite making this choice for herself, even after all her second chances, she behaved as though we were shutting her out or trying to exclude her. She has no self awareness as a person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal Info:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you are uncomfortable with talk about sexual assault, skip to the end of this post as separated by the line.&lt;/em&gt; Where I come from, and Fozzie as well, and all the people she and I know, the topic of sexual assault and rape is deeply painful, careful, and minimized unless it\u2019s needed for support and healing. I know people who have been there. It\u2019s a horrible, traumatizing experience that you don\u2019t toss around in casual conversation. You don\u2019t know what other people have been through, so you are careful with your words as a decent human being so you don\u2019t make a victim uncomfortable or bring up memories they can\u2019t deal with in that moment. Miss Piggy\u2026 I don\u2019t even know how to find the right descriptors for this. I\u2019ll just go ahead with it. Miss Piggy, by her admittance, was a victim of rape during her teenage years. She\u2019s in her early/mid 20s now. This was sometime after the \u201cdoctors tried to make me anorexic because I was overweight\u201d and at least a year or two before high school graduation. It\u2019s an awful thing to have happened, and despite both Fozzie and I feeling discomforted by casual conversation about that kind of experience, we defaulted into listening mode because it\u2019s assumed that when someone brings that up about themselves, they need to for healing and they need support. But Miss Piggy talked about it &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; and the way she spoke about it almost seemed like she was bragging about it. It may have just been her vocabulary or mannerisms, but it made Fozzie and I extremely uncomfortable. Still, we didn\u2019t deny her the freedom to divulge, because it very well could have been her way of healing, maybe normalizing the experience so she could better move on from it. And we can forgive that. We wanted her to feel safe and comfortable if that\u2019s what she needed. What we couldn\u2019t forgive, which we discussed later on when it was just Fozzie and I a few weeks after the trip, was that she seemed to use it to justify some kind of right to talk about &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; people\u2019s experiences. She\u2019d tell us about other people being raped, like her cousin, or friends of hers. If I was a victim, I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be okay with someone blabbing about that fact to everyone they meet. I wouldn\u2019t want to meet someone for the first time, and all them being able to think is \u201cthis person was raped,\u201d while they\u2019re shaking my hand. It\u2019s invasive. And victims have suffered more than enough invasion &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; personal gossip. And while I may never meet her cousin or friends, Fozzie HAS met one of those friends, and felt horrible about knowing she was a victim. She did not know this about the girl until Miss Piggy gossiped about it to us, which clearly means if she hadn\u2019t told Fozzie herself then she didn\u2019t want Fozzie to know. And here was Miss Piggy, spreading this stuff behind this girl\u2019s back without her consent. I can\u2019t even come up with the words to describe how disrespectful and carless this is to do to someone. If this wasn&amp;#39;t wholly anonymous, I wouldn&amp;#39;t even mention it to you guys. Even now I feel bad about it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. That\u2019s the end of Miss Piggy. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Miss Piggy is not a person worth meeting.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "As promised, here is a small set of final thoughts and information on [Miss Piggy\u2019s misadventures.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/63511a/on_the_road_with_miss_piggy_1/)\n\nThis instalment won\u2019t be in story form, but will be me telling you all about a few things that didn\u2019t seem functional to the story.

Miss Piggy, by her admittance, was a victim of rape during her teenage years. She\u2019s in her early/mid 20s now. This was sometime after the \u201cdoctors tried to make me anorexic because I was overweight\u201d and at least a year or two before high school graduation. It\u2019s an awful thing to have happened, and despite both Fozzie and I feeling discomforted by casual conversation about that kind of experience, we defaulted into listening mode because it\u2019s assumed that when someone brings that up about themselves, they need to for healing and they need support.

This was sometime after the \u201cdoctors tried to make me anorexic because I was overweight\u201d and at least a year or two before high school graduation. It\u2019s an awful thing to have happened, and despite both Fozzie and I feeling discomforted by casual conversation about that kind of experience, we defaulted into listening mode because it\u2019s assumed that when someone brings that up about themselves, they need to for healing and they need support.
