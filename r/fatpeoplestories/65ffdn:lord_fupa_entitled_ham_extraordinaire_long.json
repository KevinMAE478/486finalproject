About 5\u20199, he looks to weigh about 470 pounds (213 kilos). I am not thin at all, but he makes me feel like I\u2019m a stick. He is wearing a tent of a shirt, and the back is drenched in sweat. His hair is also wet with sweat and is plastered to his head and the back of his neck. It\u2019s hot as hell where I live, but the amount of sweat I was seeing was excessive.

He\u2019s not listening to me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I follow him out to the open lab and he points out the planet from before. On top of being so big that I hear the chair crying for help, he is pimply as hell. His fupa is immense, bits of it leaking out of his basketball shorts.

I\u2019m allergic to nicotine, so my brain is screaming at me to get away, but my sense of duty is telling me to help him as fast as I can, then go hide.

I can help with that.\u201d &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I quickly show him how to print. He puts in his credentials and accepts the cost of the print job. So far, so good. I point at the printers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: \u201cAlright, sir. You can swipe your card over there and collect your papers. If you\u2019ll excuse me.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turn away from him, already planning to escape to the safety of the break room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lord Fupa: \u201cExcuse you!

I side-step it and it falls to the ground. My patience has officially gone out the window to join the niceties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: \u201cSir, do not throw things at me. If I see you throw one more thing at anyone in here, I will call public safety and have you escorted from campus.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lord Fupa: \u201cI\u2019m a student here! You have to go get my papers! It\u2019s too far for me to walk and I have a bad knee! I\u2019m paying your salary!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pick up his ID and place it on the desk in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: \u201cI am not your servant and I watched you walk in here just fine a while ago. The printers are over there.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I point again. Lord Fupa stands up suddenly and mock-lunges at me. In fear of being suffocated under many layers of fat and beetus, I back up in a panic. But, an angelic force in the form of a public safety officer comes into the lab to clean out our printer paystation. Lord Fupa sees him and quickly shuffles off to the printers. I consider telling the officer, but since Lord Fupa didn\u2019t actually lay his hands on me, I decided it was more trouble than it was worth and let it go. I let Tank know I was going on my break and went into the break room to take some deep breaths and calm down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After my break was done, I\u2019m walking back out to the lab, just in time to see Lord Fupa about to hit the bar of the emergency exit door. I run over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Me: \u201cWoah, hey! You can\u2019t go out that way!\u201d&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lord Fupa: \u201cWhy the hell not? My car\u2019s out this way!

I follow him to make sure he doesn\u2019t try anything else. Lo and behold, he reaches out and pushes one of our computers to the ground, then walks out of the lab. Tank is wide-eyed. I ask Tank to call public safety while I start to look for the damage to the computer. Lord Fupa\u2019s actions were caught on camera, and in addition to paying for the computer repairs, he was banned from the campus for a year and I slept a little better that night knowing I won\u2019t have to deal with him, hopefully ever again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you guys liked this story, I have a couple of others that can be told, both of them involving my use of a cane when I fractured my knee last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR - A student ham acts like a fuckwad, orders me to get his print job by claiming the printers are too far away for him to walk to.
