I procrastinated because I don&amp;#39;t want to come across as hating people who are overweight. The issues this person caused in this story are the result of being selfish and inconsiderate, and their fat was a side-effect of those traits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My coworker &amp;quot;Dan&amp;quot; and I were comparing side trails of a popular hiking spot via phone pictures. Our ~240 lb coworker, &amp;quot;Nancy,&amp;quot; asked how we afford to go on vacations all the time. We explained this place was about 2 hours drive from the office, an easy driving route and easy low grade trail. (You don&amp;#39;t start someone out with a miserable arduous hike to get them interested in the outdoors.) Showed her some photos of the wildlife we&amp;#39;d seen, the river, lake, small waterfalls and walking along the mountain ridges.\nNancy seemed fascinated by this magical place, so we invited her family. Dan said we&amp;#39;d all go together. Lunch, kayaking, you name it. We&amp;#39;ll provide our stuff and you&amp;#39;re free to use it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nancy, her boyfriend (similar shape, but taller) and their kids piled into the car and off we went. It was about 55 degrees and sunny. On the way, Nancy and Co. exclaimed about the lack of restaurants. That was it. Not the scenery, just no restaurants. Whatever, I don&amp;#39;t expect open-mouthed praise. I&amp;#39;d offered up a loaf of bread, peanut butter and jelly and black beans and tortillas. I&amp;#39;d brought more than enough for five adult sized people (Dan, myself, Nancy, her eldest child and her Boyfriend) and two kids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After our picnic next to the lake, we started teaching the kids how to safely kayak. Nancy didn&amp;#39;t feel well. I&amp;#39;m hot, I&amp;#39;m cold, I feel sick. I felt bad for her, so gave her the key to my car to go back and rest. Her boyfriend went with her. In any other situation, this would be all kinds of red flags. Me and my coworker with their three kids we&amp;#39;d never met before and handing keys over. To be fair, I thought she was genuinely ill and her kids were busy being taught to kayak with Dan. We eventually shored the kayaks and headed up the trail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kids had a blast. Dan and I found a new appreciation for all the little things we take for granted through these kids who had never been to the forest before. (Never? There was a teenager and we live near a national forest.) Either way, they waded in the river, climbed up a small waterfall, climbed on everything and were grinning and getting along famously. Took tons of pictures of them to give to Nancy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our hike took about 4 times longer than usual because the kids wanted to do everything, and that was fine by us. We crossed back over the river to the parking area about 5pm and...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You saw this coming, didn&amp;#39;t you. It was obvious what happened. Nancy and her boyfriend stole my car to drive half down the mountain to a burger place. I thought for sure she&amp;#39;d had a medical emergency and was driven somewhere by her boyfriend. Dan and I went about trying to figure out how to get everyone back home in his 2-seater truck with 4 hour round trips. Our phones did not have service in the mountain valley, it was getting dark, and I was concerned about leaving any of us on the mountain overnight with zero supplies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lo and behold, here come Nancy and Boyfriend around dusk. They blamed the restaurant taking too long with their sit-down order. They thought it would be inconsiderate to eat it in my &amp;quot;borrowed&amp;quot; car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were children present and I work with these people, so my line of questioning was, &amp;quot;and you thought it was okay to lie to me about being sick, take a car that isn&amp;#39;t yours, leave your kids and your hosts in the woods in the dark to go eat greasy food when there&amp;#39;s plenty left in the cooler?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nancy was taken aback that I accused her of lying. She was sick, she swore up and down. She ate too much for breakfast and lunch in anticipation of a four mile hike and vomited due to the exertion of helping load kayaks into the water. Now she&amp;#39;s angry with me. Me, the person whose car she just stole. The person who &amp;quot;was babysitting&amp;quot; her kids.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But wait, there&amp;#39;s more! Oh. No there&amp;#39;s not more. They came back, ate enough packed food for 7 people to have a moderate after-hike dinner, then they went to eat! All our food, including for their own children, was gone. Their solution was to go back to the burger place and Dan and I would foot the bill for ourselves and their three kids. Because the only tourist spot for junk food is expensive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dan and I bought their kids food and went without, ourselves. We didn&amp;#39;t want the trip to be ruined for the kids. Our drive back was peppered with stories from the kids about the cool stuff they&amp;#39;d done on the hike, and Nancy and Boyfriend making disparaging noises.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It took two weeks for Nancy to speak to me, on social media, to ask about the pics of her kids. Nancy uploaded them as her own (hey, they&amp;#39;re her kids and I gave her the pictures) and went on and on about things that happened on her hike that didn&amp;#39;t even happen because she wasn&amp;#39;t there. How they&amp;#39;re avid hikers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later on, I asked if her kids would like to come hiking with me again. She aid no, and her reasoning was that it was too much work for her (??), I had made her feel bad about it, and I had set unreasonable standards for her kids.
