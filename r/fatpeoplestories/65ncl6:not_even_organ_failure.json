You can chalk that up to my terrible diet, being overweight, having high blood pressure when I was as young as 12, etc. I tried to turn my life around and do better, but it still wasn&amp;#39;t enough (and truth be told, I half-assed it because HAES and FA and &amp;quot;muh cuuuuuurves&amp;quot;), and I did mental leaps to convince myself it wasn&amp;#39;t as bad as I thought it was, and that my kidneys would last at least until I was 30. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I received my transplant 3 days before my 25th birthday, so you can see how well that worked. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So for the next X years I&amp;#39;ll spend on this earth, I will have a compromised immune system, be looking for insurance that won&amp;#39;t be nuts to afford my meds that I am forever tied to, AND i work in a field that is teeming with pathogens just waiting to make me mortally sick. That, and the fact that this new kidney will maybe last 15-20 years if I&amp;#39;m lucky have kicked my ass in gear to make sure that I&amp;#39;m as healthy as I can be, to the point where I don&amp;#39;t question the doctor&amp;#39;s orders, I&amp;#39;m eating right, dealing with eating issues, and exercising more (down from 224lbs to 146, only 1lb away from &amp;quot;normal weight&amp;quot;). Now more than ever, my health is extremely important to me so I can live comfortably and not get sick and die early.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What irks me the most is that at the hospital I had the surgery done at, I can see the other kidney patients waiting to see the doctors.  They&amp;#39;re all overweight. Almost every time I go to the waiting room I&amp;#39;m surrounded by a sea of hams, some of which have respirators with them, some of which have to sit in those bariatric chairs, some of which are out of breath just coming out of the elevators. I see what they eat; I can hear it, I can smell it: massive Starbeetus drinks, bags of fast food, crinkling of wrappers and who knows what else. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand what is going through these people&amp;#39;s minds: to get a transplant, you have to be within a certain weight range (I was lucky in that even overweight, the surgery could still be performed because I did not have too much abdominal fat). To keep a kidney you at least have to have some semblance of desire to be healthy and want to do better. These people look like they make no attempt whatsoever at trying to be more healthy. I hear them list out their medications and even then, they don&amp;#39;t remember them all--they take too many! Sure some issues won&amp;#39;t resolve with weight loss, but a lot will! I also don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re aware that having diabetes will put a great strain on the kidneys and can cause them to take a lot of damage too. Do they care? Nah, they got insulin, or whatever they take. They argue with the doctors that they &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t have time&amp;quot; to take their meds on an empty stomach! (some anti-rejection meds need to be taken an hour before and after any food consumption for the greatest absorption) And the doctor will explain that that&amp;#39;s fine, but they should eat something small if that&amp;#39;s the case, like a piece of toast, or 1 egg. They&amp;#39;ll whine and complain that they get cranky, it&amp;#39;s not enough food to start they day out with, they don&amp;#39;t like toast/eggs/etc, all sorts of excuses. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I&amp;#39;ll see thin people and get a little hopeful, that hey, someone is trying! And then I&amp;#39;ll hear that they were actually a kidney donor for their family, and their family member sitting next to them is twice the donor&amp;#39;s size.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw one mother gather her children around her in one of the tables in the waiting rooms, which passing around bags of fast food that there was a possibility that she would lose her kidney. She was not a thin woman. Her kids were on their ways to being mini-moons but hadn&amp;#39;t reached it at that point, thank heavens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seriously breaks my heart that even though I&amp;#39;m still overweight, I&amp;#39;m one of the thinnest kidney transplant patients, and all things considered, probably one of the healthiest. I got knocked from 5+ meds before surgery to 2 necessary, and 1 as needed for narcolepsy.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s the real kicker, guys: If you are in the US, congrats! Your tax dollars helped me pay for my ~$200,000 surgery to where I only had to pay maybe $1000 out of pocket for traveling expenses, premiums/deductibles for insurance, etc. They also helped pay for every other hamplanet&amp;#39;s surgery, and if those hams don&amp;#39;t take care of themselves, you&amp;#39;ll still be paying for them: their 10+ medications, the cost of possible dialysis, the diagnostics the Dr has to perform, the next transplant surgery that will be performed to give them their 4th or 5th kidney (thereby taking it away from an individual who is in need). Because guess what? When you reach End Stage Renal Failure, you qualify for Medicare (which is a godsend if you&amp;#39;re young with a not-so-stable income), and have nearly everything paid for for you! If you get a transplant, Medicare ends after 3 years--unless you lose the transplant and have to go back to dialysis, or you claim disability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It makes me irate to think that they probably know they are putting a drain on the system and leeching off of it because someone will take care of them. They are putting their love of food over their health, their families, and the people that eventually have to pay for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I bring you a late night snack to help raise your sugahs, but be prepared, this may rustle more jimmies than give you that nice beetus-high.\n\nSo I received a kidney transplant ~7 months ago because mine were failing.
