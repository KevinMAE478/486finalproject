I just waited to post it because I wanted to assure you guys that even though this bad news came to fruition, I&amp;#39;ve still stayed committed to working out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So 2 weeks ago at the end of the 3rd week of SM being my personal trainer he gave me a choice. &amp;quot;Start paying me to continue to train you&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Move onto just being gym buddies&amp;quot;. As you can imagine living off of a custodian salary I choose the ladder. Though SM said he gave me a pretty sweet deal by giving me the first 3 weeks completely free. I was in his debt and he got me in the groove of going to the gym daily for the past 3 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now here we are at the end of week 5. SM is now just a simple gym buddy. Sometimes we chat a bit while working out, but usually we stick to our own thing and pump iron at our own pace. SM still calls me &amp;quot;shoulder-pads&amp;quot; to tease me cause I still have trouble lifting a reasonable amount of weight on the shoulder press machine. Even though he&amp;#39;s not personally coaching me anymore it&amp;#39;s been pretty chill and I am really enjoying going to the gym. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m starting to lift more. Little by little and bit by bit. Progress is a little slow and weight loss has also slowed down a lot too. I was 187 2 weeks ago now I&amp;#39;m 184 (weighed myself this morning after waking up). Probably still need to work on improving my diet more. But I&amp;#39;m really starting to see results and I&amp;#39;m really happy about it. Soon I will be able to fit into size 34 pants. But honestly, I want to fit into size 32 pants when I reach my goal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where do I go from here? Well if one day I get a better job or a raise or... Something... I&amp;#39;m going to join karate again! I haven&amp;#39;t been in karate for 6 years. If you guys remember I told you guys that back when I was in high school I was 140 pounds and did karate pretty much EVERY DAY of the week. It would be great to break out my gi and black belt again and get back into the groove of kicking ass. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to keep working out and improving my overall body. And of course I&amp;#39;ll keep you guys updated with awesome beetus stories. Until next time!
