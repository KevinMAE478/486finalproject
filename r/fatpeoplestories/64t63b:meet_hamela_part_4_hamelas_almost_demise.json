Manager comes out to the main room and yells to everyone that the fire alarm is not a drill, politely disconnect your calls, and exit the building. I grab my stuff and quickly head out of the building. The office building was 9 floors, with 1-3 different companies on each floor, so by the time I get outside there are already hundreds of people grouping on the sidewalk across the street from the building. I find (Manager) and stand with her, as do many of the other employees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, the building is suuuper old. They\u2019re constantly having issues with the fire system, and there are false alarms all the time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also important to note that the elevator doesn\u2019t run at all when the fire alarm has been activated. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few fire trucks and other first responders arrive at the building, we see Nichole, a mid 30\u2019s woman from our office run out of the building. \u201cHamela\u2019s still in the building!!\u201d she\u2019s yelling as she runs across the street to our group. \u201cI told her that she needed to leave the building like (Manager) said\u2026 But she insisted that it was probably just a false alarm. I told her I\u2019d help her down the stairs since the elevator wouldn\u2019t be running\u2026 But she just wouldn\u2019t budge.\u201d Actually feel really bad for Nichole, at this point she\u2019s nearly in tears thinking Hamela might die, because she didn\u2019t make her leave the building.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/Rhhr8D5mKSX7O/giphy.gif\"&gt;Manager&amp;#39;s Face&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(Manager) goes over to the firemen to try and explain that there is someone still in the building, but they shoo her away, and explain that they\u2019ll find her when they sweep the building. 10-15 minutes have passed when we finally see Hamela emerge from the building, escorted by two firemen. She waddles to her car and gets in to sit down. \u201cHer knee can\u2019t handle standing for too long.\u201d And fortunately, Hamela has a temporary Handicap Parking Permit, so her car is parked 8 feet away from the main door of the building.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/cQtlhD48EG0SY/giphy.gif\"&gt;MFW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Luckily, no one was injured in the fire\u2026 &lt;del&gt;Except maybe the firemen that had to carry Hamela down the stairs.&lt;/del&gt; The fire wasn\u2019t major, just a small electrical fire on the top floor of the building. The person who witnessed the fire quickly put it out with a fire extinguisher, and set off the alarm to be safe. The firemen inspected where the fire had happened, and they had to hack open the wall to make sure there wasn\u2019t any smoldering insulation, exposed wires, and other stuff. We were all allowed to return to work after an hour and a half, like nothing happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the time we did get back inside, I had less than a half hour of my shift left, and Hamela was gone for lunch. So we didn\u2019t get any comments from her about the fire, or about how she was &lt;del&gt;carried&lt;/del&gt; escorted out of the building. But for the next few weeks, everything was so peaceful in the office, Hamela didn\u2019t ask us for favors, if she needed help, she contacted a Supervisor right away and she overall left us alone...

They must\u2019ve threatened her with her life, because it actually worked for awhile. Later on, Hamela puts her life in danger during a fire alarm by insisting it\u2019s a false alarm, and doesn\u2019t leave the building until &lt;del&gt;carried&lt;/del&gt; escorted out by Firemen. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/63hddz/meet_hamela_part_1_hamela_the_elusive/) | [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/63oyfv/meet_hamela_part_2_the_elevator_fiasco/) | [Part 3]( https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/643lxt/meet_hamela_part_3_the_sinking_boat/)\n\n\nHey everyone, I\u2019m back again with the next chapter of Hamela, our ~~Office Toddler~~ \u2026 ~~Office Whiner~~ \u2026 Office Hamplanet!\n\n#Handy Dandy Character Sheet\nTrixtina/OP \u2013 19, Doesn\u2019t give any fucks. \n\nAngel \u2013 Early 50\u2019s, Literally kindest woman I\u2019ve ever met.
