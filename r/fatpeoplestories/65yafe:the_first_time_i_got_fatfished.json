I went on some dates, ended up making a couple of friends weirdly enough, and had a good time. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was back home for the Fourth of July and matched with a girl. She was cute and had a funny profile, and we hit it off pretty quickly. We started texting and agreed to meet up on a Sunday evening for drinks. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First things first, she was a good 50 pounds heavier than her profile pics AND the selfies she sent when we were texting. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing she wanted to talk about was the expensive surgery her cat had just had. I love animals, (I think half my phone storage is pics and gifs of animals), but that&amp;#39;s not a great first topic when you meet someone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After finishing that story, she says she wants to let me know that she was just getting out of a six-month relationship because she found out her boyfriend was a meth user. I asked how it took her so long to find out, and she responded that it wasn&amp;#39;t obvious. I kind of snorted, so she whipped out her phone and showed me pictures. Dude could have been a Breaking Bad extra. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, I got up to use the restroom, to which she said &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re not going to leave, right?&amp;quot; It might have been funny if she wasn&amp;#39;t completely stonefaced, and she would say the same thing every time one of us got up to get drinks or use the restroom. In the bathroom, I thought about bolting, but I decided to see how deep the rabbit hole went. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We decided to order some appetizers; I picked one and she picked two. Right as they got to the table, I got a panicked text and phone call from one of my students freaking out about their test the next day (I work in test prep). I excused myself to step outside and talk my student off the ledge, taking about 15 minutes to do so. When I returned, her two appetizers were gone and mine was conveniently about half-finished. The server soon showed up with a dessert as well. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She finishes her dessert, and we get ready to leave. I walk her to her car because I&amp;#39;m a gentleman like that, and after unlocking her car, she says she has something she wants to tell me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I want to be up front and tell you that I&amp;#39;m currently going through a divorce.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...I thought you just broke up with your boyfriend.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I did, I left my husband for him&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no idea how to respond.
