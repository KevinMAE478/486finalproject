I don&amp;#39;t feel as anxious with him around, and he&amp;#39;s always down for a hug if I&amp;#39;m depressed and feel alone. Shit, he cries with me. He&amp;#39;s surprisingly empathetic for a dog.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But today I took him for a walk. I had my tunes, and the sun was out so I was pretty damn content. I&amp;#39;m working on \u201cheel\u201d with Lemmy so the walk was mostly me keeping him on a short leash and trying to stop him from choking himself (I need to get him a new harness, he chewed the old one up).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was walking around the block twice with him, sweating to some oldies (nothing quite like Pink Floyd while you&amp;#39;re sweating under the sun) when I saw someone making actually really funny looking gestures out of the corner of my eye.
