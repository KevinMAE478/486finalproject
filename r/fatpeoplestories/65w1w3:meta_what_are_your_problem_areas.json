Not sure if you&amp;#39;re into outside solutions but this is exactly what cool-sculpting is made for. It&amp;#39;s a laser that targets and kills fat cells in a particular area (because you can&amp;#39;t naturally target weight loss, cool-sculpting can target it for you by killing the actual fat cells).  Then, ideally, you get to the weight you&amp;#39;re comfortable with and are able to target weight loss only in those problem areas. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;", "subreddit": "fatpeoplestories", "name": "t1_dgdygt7", "score_hidden": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1492485239.0, "created_utc": 1492456439.0, "depth": 1, "mod_reports": [], "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": -3}}], "after": null, "before": null}}, "user_reports": [], "id": "dgdnolm", "gilded": 0, "archived": false, "score": 5, "report_reasons": null, "author": "HAES_al_ghul", "parent_id": "t3_65w1w3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/fatpeoplestories", "controversiality": 0, "body": "Love handles.
